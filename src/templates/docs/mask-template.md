## Concept
Outline the holistic concept of this mask.
There is no need to get into specific details about the implementation: just communicate the high-level ideas and interactions that are meant to happen.

## Abilities
Describe any abilities, powers, or equipment that this mask provides.
This does not need to be super specific: it can be as vague as "a strong sidearm" or "shoots fireballs."
Just outline any mechanical differences between the base character and someone with this mask.

## Gameplay
Describe the type of social deduction gameplay this mask is supposed to create.
Outline any relevant relationships with other systems or masks.
Elaborate on the inherent intrigue--how does the mask obscure itself, or generate ambiguity?

## Variants
Describe possible variants this mask could implement and how they affect their abilities, items, objectives, and overall gameplay.
This is not strictly necessary if you don't plan on implementing any variants, and should be omitted in most cases.
General variants are listed in the mask doc, such as dubious, professional, or chaotic. However, you can have mask-specific variants if design makes it work nicely.
