Sometimes you may lose faith in the good way and wonder "why do we bother writing so many documents for things?"

You're not remiss for thinking this, so let's go over the **why's**:
1. It is useful to others who want to implement things
2. It is useful to you because you crystalize the design as you write it
3. It is useful to outsiders who may be inspired by your designs
4. It is useful to the future to help preserve the ideas and reasoning behind things
5. It is useful to maintainers who need to understand if a change is in line with the original vision
6. It is fun

Don't be afraid of writing.
It's not meant to be an insurmountable trial where you have to enumerate every single detail and edge case of your design.
Rather, docs are simply the blueprint of features: the distilled core elements of mechanics that must be considered when developing.
By communicating these ideas, you ensure that your ideas aren't distorted over time by others.
