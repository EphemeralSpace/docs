# Terminology

Getting confused by the weird ass dialect we've built for ourselves with all our pheemy nonsense? Here's a rundown of some specific terminology and what it's referring to ingame.

## Characters

**Theatergoer:** Player

**Stagehand:** Part observer, part game master; a special role that watches the show

**Extra:** Ghost role

**Ephemera:** NPC characters that inhabit the theater.
They have dialogue when interacted with and do not appear within the round itself.

**Pheemy:** An indescribable pet/child that you raise inside the theater.
A mixture between a torture simulator and tamagotchi.

## Locations

**Theater:** The combined lobby and ghost bar.
Players interact here before the round and dead players collect here again when out of the game.

**Stage:** The area at the front of the theater where players ready up and join into the round.

**Side Rooms:** A section of the theater consisting of sprawling, labyrinthine rooms with wild designs.
An area for players to explore between rounds.

## Concepts

**Show:** Round

**Masks:** Special roles that players are assigned outside of jobs.
Each gives objectives and potential special abilities.

**Pheem:** It's pheemy, man. You know what this means.
