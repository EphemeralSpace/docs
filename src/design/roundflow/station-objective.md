# Station Objective

{{#template ../../templates/unimplemented.md }}

The station objective is the primary task of the [Crew Troupe](../masks/crew.md) as well as the overall reason for your presence on the station.
Its completion marks the end of the round, causing all other troupes to fail their objectives and for everyone to return to the lobby.

Note that this is not meant to be a super proactive or difficult to accomplish goal, like most troupe objectives.
Rather, the station objective is simply a timer that measures basic station competency, ensuring that the crew will eventually win if no threats completely disrupt them.

## The Story So Far
The station itself houses an advanced and highly experimental teleportation device, which the former crew were studying.
During their research, however, the teleportation device underwent a catastrophic event, injuring the crew and drawing in a massive storm of cosmic radiation.

You and your crewmates have been sent by NT to save the station by finishing the research and using the device to teleport it out of the way of the radiation storm.
Keep in mind, however, that other parties may be interested in the device for their own needs.

All-in-all: it's a suicide mission.
You either come out with the station or perish in the storm.
Nobody can help you, not with the wave of radiation closing in.

## Telescience
The objective revolves around a singular machine: the portal generator.
This is a large unwieldy device housed within science, taking up an entire room with its various components and consoles.

To start progressing the objective, constant power must be provided to the machine and all of its parts must be in working order.
As power is supplied, it charges up until it's ready for an activation event.
At this point, all further charging is paused.

To continue advancing the objective, the portal generator must be manually activated, causing a **Telescience Event** to occur.
Telescience Events are similar to station events, causing various dangerous things to happen across the station.
These events create portals, which can spawn mobs, anomalies, or various other alien objectives over the station.

Once the portal device has been activated enough times, it will finish, teleporting the station away from the encroaching radiation storm and allowing the evac shuttle to come.

Should the crew not complete it in time, radiation will bake everyone, ending the round with a failure for everyone.
