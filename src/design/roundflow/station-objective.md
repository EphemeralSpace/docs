# Station Objective

{{#template ../../templates/unimplemented.md }}

The station objective is the primary task of the [Crew Troupe](../masks/crew.md) as well as the overall reason for your presence on the station.
Its completion marks the end of the round, causing all other troupes to fail their objectives and for everyone to return to the lobby.

## The Story So Far
The station itself houses an advanced and highly experimental teleportation device, which the former crew were studying.
During their research, however, the teleportation device underwent a catastrophic event, injuring the crew and drawing in a massive storm of cosmic radiation.

You and your crewmates have been sent by NT to save the station by finishing the research and using the device to teleport it out of the way of the radiation storm.
Keep in mind, however, that other parties may be interested in the device for their own needs.

All-in-all: it's a suicide mission.
You either come out with the station or perish in the storm.
Nobody can help you, not with the wave of radiation closing in.

## Telescience
The core of science is built around the teleportation device: an unwieldy structure the size of a room and filled with strange devices.
Its origin is unknowable, but it likely isn't human-made.
It looks otherworldly and almost as if it's alive.

To activate the device, it must both be powered and supplied with plasma gas.
Each activation ramps in intensity and moves it closer to completion, though it must cool down between each one.
After five activations, the device has been fully realized and can be activated one more time to teleport the station and complete the objective.

Note however that activating the device is not a safe process.
Every time it runs, tears in space appear, leaking out anomalies, alien devices, and even monsters.
It's the job of science and the crew to manage these threats while continuing to run the teleporter so that it can complete before the radiation closes in.

Should the crew not complete it in time, radiation will bake everyone, ending the round with a failure for everyone.
