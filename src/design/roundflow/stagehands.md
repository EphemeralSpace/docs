# Stagehands

{{#template ../../templates/partially-implemented.md issue=https://github.com/EphemeralSpace/ephemeral-space/issues/70 }}

Stagehands are a constantly available OOC role that players outside the round can take.
They take the place of the more conventional observer/ghost, though they share a lot of the same properties.

A key element of distinction between stagehands and traditional observers is requiring the player to opt-into being a stagehand.
When players die, they are first returned to the [lobby](lobby-readying-up.md), where they can mingle and talk to other players but are otherwise separated from the events of the round.
To become a stagehand, they must specifically opt into it, at which point they are locked into being a stagehand for the remainder of the round.

This solves a very common problem with observing gameplay in most servers: **metaknowledge**.
Hidden knowledge can be shown to observers without introducing metaknowledge into play.
Since becoming a stagehand and receiving that info is conditional on never being able to return to normal play, there is no risk of potentially ruining a round by exposing what should've been hidden.
This means that the breadth of knowledge that is given to observers can be expanded, allowing them to better spectate and watch the story of the round.

## Voting

While stagehands are primarily passive observer roles, they are collectively able to influence the round through votes.
These votes, which are started by the game at various points throughout the round, can be quite impactful, ranging from minor destruction to potential major threats, so stagehands are encouraged to coordinate and select the most interesting option possible.

This in effect creates a sort of "organic game director," where instead of leaving choices up to random chance or algorithms, real people can be given the chance to make those decisions.
These observers, by virtue of being equal parts spectators and participants in the game with stakes and desires, are likely to choose options which create some sort of interesting outcome (though they may need to be 'adjusted' slightly).

### Blessings & Curses {.es-unimplemented}

Blessings and curses are types of stagehand-initiated vote that allows them to have a more targeted effect on the round.
Rather than simply choosing options, a stagehand can create a vote for a specific action (good or bad) to happen targeting another player.
The other stagehands are then required to vote Yes or No whether the action should be allowed to occur.

This essentially functions as a player-oriented version of admemes, where the stagehands as a collective can choose to reward or punish players for their actions, often to great comedic effect.
While these things obviously shouldn't have as high of a game impact as regular votes, they can be a nice opportunity for the game to karmically respond to the things people are doing during a round.

### On Impact

Stagehands provide a valuable type of reintroduction into the round compared to more conventional options like ghost roles.

For a ghost role, their impact on the round must necessarily be inversely proportional to their frequency, as to not allow them to overrun the action of the round.
With stagehands, however, since each player only has a small individual part in these high-impact decisions, many more players are able to participate through this way than they might otherwise.
