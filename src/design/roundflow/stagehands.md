# Stagehands

{{#template ../../templates/partially-implemented.md issue=https://github.com/EphemeralSpace/ephemeral-space/issues/70}}

Stagehands are an OOC role that players can take after they die.
They take the place of the conventional observer/ghost, though they share a lot of the same properties.
Stagehands are able to invisibly observe the show, flying around the station and watching events unfold.
Additionally, they're given strong metaknowledge tools like players' masks and objectives, which help them follow along with peoples' motivations.

However, players do not automatically become stagehands upon death.
Instead, they are first returned to the [lobby](lobby-readying-up.md), where they can then choose to opt into playing as a stagehand, which locks them into that role for the remainder of the round.

This solves a very common problem with observer gameplay in most servers: **metaknowledge**.
Hidden knowledge can be shown to stagehands without introducing metaknowledge into play, since stagehands are unable to return to the round in any way.
As such, players are better able to follow the personal stories of others while mitigating the risk of introducing potentially harmful knowledge into the round.

Stagehands also create a way to keep people involved with the round without resorting to options like ghost roles.
For a ghost role, their impact on the round must necessarily be inversely proportional to their frequency, as to not allow them to overrun the action of the round.
With stagehands, however, since each player only has a small part in these high-impact decisions, many more players are able to participate than they would otherwise.

## Voting

Stagehands are collectively able to influence the round through votes which are run regularly through the round.
These votes can impact various portions of the game, with stagehands given the option to influence what happens during the round.

This in effect creates a sort of "organic game director," where instead of leaving choices up to random chance or algorithms, real people can be given the chance to make those decisions.
These observers, by virtue of being equal parts spectators and participants in the game with stakes and desires, are likely to choose options which create some sort of interesting outcome (though they may need to be 'adjusted' slightly).

Additionally, it creates a situation where, even though stagehands are not part of the physical round, they are still capable of having an impact on things as a group.
Stagehands can freely talk with each other and coordinate votes to create interesting decisions, which helps lessen the feeling of being "excluded" from the round after death.

## Nudges {.es-unimplemented}

Nudges are used by stagehands to individually influence the players in round with minor status effects. A nudge can be positive or negative, but opposing nudges nullify eachother.
By directly affecting specific players, stagehanding becomes much more influential; but the passive nature of the buffs means the player can still go up against all odds, or fail dramatically even with the backing of every single audience member.

The idea is to continue the concepts of an organic game director, but in a way that the stagehands compete for their favourite characters, whereas votes act as more of an influence over the station as a whole. The stagehands are generally motivated by wanting to create the most interesting round for them to watch, so they may set up someone to be a "main character", or nudge a group of intertwined objectives in a certain direction.

It also acts as a roundabout karmic system; if someone murders someone else for no reason, the victim and crew stagehands will want to nudge them negatively as they're going against the crew objective et cetera; but if they enjoy the chaos the murderer may be rewarded.

### Nudgeconomy {.es-unimplemented}

Once a nudge is applied to a player, it cannot be retrieved until they die.
Each stagehand has a certain amount of nudges depending on how many of their objectives they have completed in their time in the spotlight.
If a stagehand has had a positive nudge on a player when they complete an objective, they gain points towards new nudges depending on the difficulty of the objective, how long it's been applied, and how many nudges are opposing them; the same goes for a negative nudge on someone who dies. [TODO: unsure about this. It seems like it would just encourage betting on whoever will win instead of whoever is the most interesting option]
An important note is that earning a new nudge should be very hard - a stagehand should have to make various good choices to gain the power.

The goal of the nudgeconomy is that as the round decays and more people die the stagehands will gain influence, so once it comes down to a few players a very large amount of nudges will be in play creating a large amount of tension.
