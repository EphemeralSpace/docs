# Station Events
Station Events are random station-wide occurrences that server to introduce minor conflict, distraction, and/or degradation into the round.
While events should create a momentary pause in typical gameplay, they shouldn't be massively disrupting the round to the point where the main gameplay of [masks](../masks/masks.md) is sidelined.

In the context of Ephemeral Space, station events are regularly selected by **stagehands** via a regularly occuring vote.
While some event options may not be available on certain population levels, the events themselves are agnostic to the number of dead or alive players.

## Autonomous Chaos
The vast majority of station events should not involve or rely upon player-controlled mobs to create engagement.
Unlike mid-round threats, station events can occur with any number of available ghost role players, including zero.
As such, rely on either environmental hazards or sole NPCs which can deliver the effects of the event.

## Destruction
Station events should never dramatically alter the course of gameplay.
While their effects, compounded by the normal things happening on station, may lead to the crew being entirely overwhelmed, they should not be solely responsible.
As such, refrain from events which can unilaterally destroy or kill large parts of the station.

## Examples
- **Good |** Meteors: Serves as a gradual destruction of exterior fixtures and provides low-stakes repair gameplay on the external parts of the station.
- **Bad |** Immovable Rod: Essentially a meteor turned up way too high. A single rod can not only kill several people, but instantly cripple core station infrastructure with no way to recover or repair it.
- **Good |** Radiation Storm: While it can be deadly, the event alerts the people on station and provides an opportunity to evade it.
- **Bad |** Vent Critters: The various mobs are often too powerful to realistically be defeated by players, leading to them causing an excessive amount of damage.
- **Good |** Carp Migration: The carps are relatively easy to defeat and their AI is able to accomplish their behavior.
- **Bad |** Closet Skeleton: The skeleton's efficacy and impact is determined entirely be the player who gets the role, leading to wildly different power level and impact from round to round.
