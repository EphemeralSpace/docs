# Kill

> *ATTENTION, OPERATIVE. The captain is carrying valuable corporate secrets about the Syndicate that would compromise your mission. Make absolutely certain that they're dead before you arm the nuclear warhead.*

## Gameplay
Kill objectives only select members of Command and Security.

Once the correct target listed in the objective is killed, the objective will be marked as complete.

## Why
Killing is something we want to encourage for traitors because it helps drive the round flow & continual degredation of the station - especially with regards to who the kill targets are.
Limiting the objective to high-ranking crewmembers helps prevent situations in which the kill objective is not felt, and situations where the target just randomly dies. Overall, it simply ensures the objective is of higher impact then it otherwise would be.

Kill objectives also happen to be very inherintly dynamic & varied - they're something that players will have to respond and think on their feet in terms of how to best approach the kill objective in relation to the game state.
For example, a suspicious security officer may assemble a defense force, requiring the traitors to team up for an all-out-assault, or the captain might be in medbay and a golden opprutunity may present itself in the moment.

The relative dynamicism also makes it useful as a "pace breaker" compared to the other objectives, which are mainly centered around sabotaging static devices.
