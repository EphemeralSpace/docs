## Gameplay
Kill objectives come in to flavors: Kill from Clues, and Kill Command / Security member.
Kill from Clues uses the clues system, not giving an explicit name to the traitor's target, forcing the player to deduce who their objective is. Kill Command / Security tells you your objective, but is limited to only members of command and security. 

Once the correct target listed in the objective is killed, the objective will be marked as complete.

## Why
Killing is something we want to encourage for traitors because it helps drive the round flow & continual degredation of the station.
Generally, the limitations on how the kill objectives are given act as variety within the objective itself, and prevent some of the problems the kill objective normally faces.
As-is in normal SS1X, when kill objectives are simpliy divied out to traitors with no limitations on who is selected, they often end up being fairly underwhelming, or even end up completing themselves automatically from forces outside of the player's control.

Kill from Clues introduces intruige compared to a simple blanket "kill this player" objective, and give traitors a reason to engage in their *own* deduction-related gameplay.
Kill Command / Security makes the targets inherintly much higher value, making the given objective much more weighty when both executing it and playing with its aftereffects.
Both objectives are flawed in some senses, but complement eachother. Kill from Clues still suffers from the auto-completion problem more then Kill Command / Security does, but it divies out danger to the crew & makes killing more interesting.
Kill Command / Security makes the targets much more straightforward and valuable, while also reducing the auto-completion problem - but, in isolation, it would encourage bad play patterns, since players would have no reason to fear traitors killing them.

Kill objectives also happen to be very inherintly dynamic & varied - they're something that players will have to respond and think on their feet in terms of how to best approach the kill objective in relation to the game state.
For example, a suspicious security officer may assemble a defense force, requiring the traitors to team up for an all-out-assault, or the captain might be in medbay and a golden opprutunity may present itself in the moment.
The relative dynamicism also makes it useful as a "pace breaker" compared to the other objectives, which are mainly centered around sabotaging static devices.
