# Connoisseur

{{#template ../../templates/removed-unimplemented.md reason="would almost certainly not have any interesting effect on the game, especially considering it's an oracle *and* doesn't have any real tell to the players being observed, similar to empath"}}

> *Huh? Why have I been sitting in the bar for 15 minutes straight? Oh, just, you know. Watching. Observing. Why don't you go back to the drink you were mixing--and anyway, you're obviously awful at this whole "silly guzzler bartender" act.*

## Concept

The Connoisseur is an Oracle-type mask that can observe others with an action, learning after a doafter 3-4 completely random masks which the target is definitely not.

## Abilities

The Connoisseur can target a player, with a looping doafter and success/fail conditions identical to the [Enthraller](./enthraller.md)--i.e, they must remain in line of sight for 20-30 seconds, with a short cooldown on fail and a longer cooldown on success. If successful, the Connoisseur learns 3-4 masks which the target is definitely not, at this moment.

This ability cannot be used on unconscious or dead players.

## Gameplay

The Connoisseur is a mask that can learn very valuable information about targets, especially if they're directly claiming to be a certain mask, and you can get proof that they're lying. However, the process of doing so is liable to get them into conflict with others, wondering why they're breaking into departments just to stare at people endlessly.

The Connoisseur's action provides some co-deniability with the [Enthraller](./enthraller.md)'s action, which are functionally identical.
