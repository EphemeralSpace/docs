```admonish warning
Will probably change a bit with offmed/psychomed, but there's a lot that's interesting to work with when it does. Maybe get heartrate/pain to a certain extent, deal with low blood levels, receive certain types of wounds, etc.

## Concept

The Daredevil is a mask that tries to put itself in dangerous environments without actually dying as a result of them. As a result, it may find itself in weird situations, and heading to Medical a few too many times.

## Abilities

One-time adrenaline if in critical condition like the [Parasite](../jester/parasite.md). Revives them just enough and gives a temporary speedboost to get out and leave if they aren't being directly pursued, but only once.

## Gameplay

The Daredevil comes into conflict with many jobs and masks as a result of their antics. Medical might be fine with it the first few times, but will quickly become less pleased with having to treat the increasingly exotic wounds that the Daredevil sustains. Because the Daredevil is often totally willing to throw themselves into very dangerous situations, they may appear like a jester-type mask, but they're actually not always cool with death. Even still, they'll be the first to volunteer to fight against an armed nuke or a blob.

Overall, this mask mostly serves to push the Daredevil player's gameplay in a weirder, less cautious direction, which can lead to fun situations.
