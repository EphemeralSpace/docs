# Mask Tokens

{{#template ../../templates/removed-unimplemented.md reason="Extracted from mask document. Mask tokens kind of directly conflict with Masquerades. You can't both pick your own mask, and also have a focused game style in play. We still want some metaincentives for objective stuff but not like this." }}

At the end of a round, if you've successfully complete your objectives, you receive a **mask token** that's associated with your account.
Between rounds, a few round's worth of tokens can be redeemed to pre-select your mask before the round begins.

This provides an incentive for completing mask objectives (to earn tokens) as well as a way to occasionally mitigate randomness.
