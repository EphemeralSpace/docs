# Sacrifice

{{#template ../../templates/removed-implemented.md reason="trigger condition is weird, effect often does nothing because when are you actually dying near people, especially bad with offmed so i removed it instead of reworking it for that. tried to come up with a better version of it and couldnt do it. ill probably revisit the concept later and revive it but not now" }}

## Concept

The Sacrifice is a Jester-type mask that heals mobs in a 5-tile radius around themselves on death, and has an objective to heal people this way in order to incentivize doing so.

## Abilities

On death, every mob within a 5 tile radius of the Sacrifice is injected with omnizine, and given a popup saying "You feel like a weight has been lifted off of your shoulders after X's sacrifice".

## Gameplay

There are many potential paths for interesting gameplay as a result of this ability: perhaps the Sacrifice could deliberately die at a tactical point in order to boost those around them, or a traitor could kill the Sacrifice intentionally or unintentionally to heal off the damage from a previous firefight. Perhaps the sacrifice is killed by crossfire, unwittingly reviving an unconscious traitor and security officer, who duke it out once again. In cases of massive danger, such as an explosion or fire, the Sacrifice can ensure that others make it out alive when they would not have otherwise.

The Sacrifice is incentivized to not reveal information about themselves early, in case somebody decides to use them as a portable heal, but their ability can be a strong boon to the crew if revealed at the right time.
