## Concept

The Philanthropist can put random luxurious items into people's backpacks, as long as they remain unseen.

## Abilities

The Philanthropist has a player-targeting action usable once (successfully) per player, with a doafter that doesn't show up for others, identical to the Pilferer's. They can activate this action only when out of sight of that player (i.e. in their viewcone's shadow, or more literally, when they're facing the same direction), taking ~1.5-2 seconds, failing if either of them move. If successful, this will spawn a random item out of a pool (maybe the current gift pool? idk) and place it into their backpack. 

If there isn't enough space in their backpack, it will attempt to place the item in their pockets, simply cancelling with a popup if this also fails.

This ability cannot be used on unconscious or dead players.

## Gameplay

The Philanthropist serves as a way to introduce some item variance into the game through their gifts--often useful things, like materials, money, or ammunition. Because the Philanthropist and Pilferer have functionally identical behavior up until the point of the action completing, people aren't incentivized to listen to a Philanthropist's plea of "heyyy lemme sneak up right behind you real quick and give you some money".
