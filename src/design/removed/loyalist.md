## Concept

The Loyalist is a rock--completely immune to all mask-swapping and mask-converting effects, including those like the Enthraller's.

## Abilities

The Loyalist is inherently immune to all abilities mentioned above. However, they will still activate any side-effects, such as the Subverter reviving the target. A failed ability use like this will also stun the attempter for a small amount of time.

## Gameplay

The Loyalist serves as an exceptionally crew-sided mask. The general theming and immunity to any attempts to alter the mask means that players are incentivized to help the crew to their fullest extent, without worrying about conversion. The stun on attempts to convert them means they can get the upper hand in situations where that might have been unthinkable, such as a traitor subversion.
