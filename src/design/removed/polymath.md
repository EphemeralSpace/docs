## Concept

The Polymath is a highly variable crew mask that receives two random abilities from other crew masks, as well as two random objectives from other crew masks.

## Abilities

The Polymath's abilities depend on the random abilities chosen for them--for example, from the Fruit Vendor, Arms Dealer, Philanthropist](./philanthropist.md), or Connoisseur. Abilities are rolled first, and then objectives. Objectives which require for certain abilities--like the Fruit Vendor's objective--should require the corresponding ability. However, other objectives may always roll, even without the corresponding ability.

## Gameplay

The Polymath generates high amounts of variable deniability for essentially any crew mask with an ability--suddenly, being able to spawn fruits out of the aether no longer implies a harmless Fruit Vendor, and it may in fact be a Polymath with the ability to kill an enemy or set fires.

The existence of the Polymath requires people to think more carefully about ability-granting masks, and the randomization allows for some truly strange combinations (Fruit Vendor with Glutton objectives, anyone?).

## Variants

- *Professional Polymath* - Rolls 3 abilities and 3 objectives, rather than 2
