# Jobs

Jobs are non-hidden roles that are randomly assigned to players every round which are defined through a combination of [clothing](../clothing.md), access, and (sometimes) unique abilities.
They are then sorted into departments, groups of jobs which share common mechanics, gameplay, and thematic elements.

Each job is not a collection of dedicated specialized feature, but rather a general "pass" to manage a certain mechanic within the game.
In this sense, jobs do not really have dedicated content which is meant to satiate their players, but rather they are simply the primary group expected to engage with a given mechanic.

## Proactive v. Reactive

Across SS1X's design, a job's duties can be broadly categorized as either **proactive** or **reactive**.
**Proactive** jobs are typically not essential to the station's general function and are instead simply given a variety of tasks to pursue over the course of a round.
**Reactive** jobs, on the other hand, derive their gameplay from occurrences on station, responding to situations as they are needed.

In general, reactive jobs should _always_ be preferred over proactive jobs.
Although a job might exhibit characteristics of both, the proactive elements of their design should ultimately serve to reinforce and prepare for the core reactive gameplay (for example, a chemist creating medicine which is then used to respond to someone getting injured).

Gameplay which is focused around responding to situations as they arise create a web of interconnected roles, as individuals call on each other to aid the station.
When a fire starts, a player reaches out to the engineering team in order to get help extinguishing it.
Likewise, when engineers hear the call, they are given a purpose to the station.
This creates a feedback loop between players, where social expectations of a job leads to their purpose being solidified in gameplay while simultaneously reinforcing their dependability as a solution to a problem.

```admonish example
A great example of something like this would be Security.
Technically, any crew member is capable of securing armaments and responding to a threat.
However, since security is specifically oriented around this task and given the most direct access to the tools required, they become a primary choice for subduing a threat.
```

### Continuous Decay

When a job isn't present, either by dying or simply not being assigned yet, it creates a gameplay void where crew is forced to pick up the slack.
This enhances the general decay of the station, as the duties of the collective crew grow as their numbers dwindle, placing greater strain on them and accelerating the descent into chaos.

Ultimately, this is something we want to lean into.
By emphasizing the absence of a job, we create greater stakes when people die, amplifying the gravity of things happening on-board the station.
After a role dies, there should be a real feeling of "Oh shit, X is gonna be so much worse now."
The game is ultimately about our relationships and interactions with others, and by making these links important, we refine this core aspect of the game's design.

## Deduction

As a deductive element, jobs can be thought of as the mirror image of [masks](../masks.md).

While a mask defines your goals and intentions on a _personal level_, a job offers you _default behavior_ as part of the [crew](../masks/crew.md).
This is extremely important to deduction, as it creates indirect methods of aiding the station, the completion of which can arouse or quell suspicion.

The most immediate comparison would be tasks in the game Among Us.
The tasks themselves aren't really meant to be substantial gameplay.
Rather, the tasks force innocents to move around the map and encounter dangerous situations while giving them the opportunity to further their success.
For imposters, it gives chances to catch lone crew members, while also giving them something obvious they can impersonate or claim to be doing.

Ephemeral Space is ultimately a game about social dynamics, not job simulation.
While the simulacra of performing a job is important to the social interaction occuring on the station, it's not the task itself which is important.
