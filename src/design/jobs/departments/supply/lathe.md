# Lathe

{{#template ../templates/unimplemented.md}}

## Core Idea(s)
**The lathe should be the main source of new items to the station.**
The lathe produces water vapour at scalding temperatures and high pressures. The water vapour will then reduce the condition of touching machines(?) and walls via rust.

## Rust
Rust should never destroy an object; it should always require an external influence to deal the final blow. This allows degredation in a round to get to the tipping point, and then be nudged over by other random events or troupes.

## Atmos Regulation
The lathe should have both a lower and higher temperature/pressure bound on running. The lower bound is to disincentivise spacing the rooms, the upper bound is to add a risk to running for continous lengths of time.
Once the upper bound is exceeded, it should light on fire and take an extra few minutes until it can run again.
