# Cargo Department

{{#template ../../templates/unimplemented.md }}

The cargo department is a set of jobs primarily focused on the acquisition and distribution of supplies to the station.
Although they do not directly purchase or sell goods, it's the job of the Cargo department to get supplies when needed and ration them out to the various people on-station.

## Warehouse
The warehouse is the center of the Cargo department, replacing the conventional shuttle dock.
The area itself consists of several colored 'lots' of pallets, where the various belongings of the station can be placed.

All containers on pallets are automatically catalogued in a central manifest, which players can view via a **Warehouse Manifest Computer**, available both in full computer and wallmount form.
This enables average crew members to make simple requests based on what cargo has in stock.
Additionally, it gives cargo techs a way to quickly look and budget what they have in stock.

### Requests
To better suit the new-orderless cargo gameplay, the various request consoles on-station have been modified.
Players may write various requests in a simple text box and submit them to Cargo to be fulfilled.
Each request console allows you to see orders associated with it, including past orders which have been actioned.
Additionally, the console sprite shows a notification icon when the status of a request has changed.

All submitted requests are viewable at the main **Request Management Console** inside of cargo.
Here, cargo staff can filter the requests by status and department and action them (Out-Of-Stock/In-Stock/Delivering/Delivered/Cancelled).
Past requests are also viewable here to allow them to be tracked over the course of a round.

## Salvage
Now that the on-station cargo staff are primarily in-charge of distributing and delivering everything that the crew needs, Salvage gets a chance to be placed in a more key position for supplies acquisition.

The primary way of obtaining additional supplies, items, and upgrades for the crew will be through collecting supplies from various debris around the station.
Individual pieces of debris will all be themed, informing what kinds of things can be found on them (which can be viewed via a guidebook provided to them).

Salvage's ability to maintain off-station exploring will be primarily limited by their ever-dwindling supply of resources.
Accumulated wounds, use of fuel, and depleted ammunition for weapons will require them to make trips back to the station to replenish themselves before going out again.

### Threats in Space
The threats that salvage encounters in space should be designed not to kill them, but simply to deplete their resources and force them to return to the station.
Salvage just dying out in space is basically the last thing we want out of the system.
They should always have the option to return home, if a little worse for wear.

Salvaging should not be a combat simulator.
It is primarily a supplies hunting mission, with the occasional threat of violence mixed in.
The mistakes salvagers make should be their own, with the only exception being rare monstrous threats that they are forced to run away from.

## Trade Ship
The trade ship is a "safe" method of acquiring certain goods, but is not without its drawbacks.

The ship is primarily operated by junker robots, frail mechanical beings who are tethered to their ship by cords.
They are entirely bound to the ship itself, though they do not need conventional sustenance beyond this.

Their main goal is profit: done primarily through bartering with the station.
They spawn with an array of goods and crates, which they can trade with the station in exchange for other goods which they deem valuable.
All junker robots are part of a troupe that has an objective to acquire a certain amount of funds from trades before exiting the sector.

In this way, the faction is an option to get some needed supplies in times of strife, but leaves the players vulnerable to exploitation and extortion to get what they want.
