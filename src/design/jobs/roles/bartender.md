# Bartender

{{#template ../../../templates/unimplemented.md}}

Bartender is a simplistic **Service** job centered around providing drinks and cocktails to the crew.
While they have a lot of similarities to the **Chef**, the role is made distinct by a larger focus on direct player interaction as well as more independent play.
Though the Bartender is not especially strong nor centralizing, their position as a place of frequent player gatherings makes them able to be highly impactful onto others.

## Strange Potions
The primary gameplay that the Bartender will be doing during the round is mixing drinks.
Much like traditional medicines, these are loosely tiered, gated primarily by access to supplies from other departments.
As the drinks require more components to assemble, their effects get stronger and stronger.

These effects are similar to the various buffs from cooking.
Far from an instant-win option, they simply provide an incentive and minor bonus to coming down to the bar and engaging with others.

Ultimately, however, these are simply above-and-beyond options for the bartender to pursue.
At the most basic level, they should always have the ability to mix up basic cocktails to satisfy thirst.

## Every Drink is Personalized
Engaging with the unique mechanics of Ephemeral Space, the Bartender's drinks are tailored towards a character's (_randomly-generated_) [clues](../../characters/clues.md).
Unlike a chef's meal, where the efficacy is determined by the sourcing of ingredients, a great Bartender must exchange information with their customer and craft a drink that meets their specific tastes.

While the lowest-impact drinks can be based on superficial elements (job, appearance, etc.), as the strength of effect goes up, so too must the obscurity of the clues.
This creates a tilting scale of information exchange, whereby giving the bartender more potentially identifying information about yourself, you receive more useful effects and buffs.
As such, the bartender becomes an extremely dynamic and interesting alternate source of player information, as they are able to give tons of useful clues about individuals they've served.
