# Coroner

{{#template ../../templates/unimplemented.md}}

The Coroner is a **Medical** job centered around the handling of dead bodies.
They guard the morgue, handle the interment of bodies, and make sure nobody gets their grubby little hands all over the corpseloot (at least not before the Coroner takes a peek). When necessary, the Coroner can take on the role of an undertaker and help make sure dead bodies actually find their way to medbay to help counteract <span class="es-unimplemented">filth</span>.

The Coroner *also* handles autopsies, which can reveal extremely important information about those who have passed on--including their cause of death, and even their mask.

## Dead Men Tell Tall Tales

The Coroner spawns with two unique items: a black briefcase intended to contain autopsy readouts, and an autopsy scalpel. Upon interacting with a dead body on top of an operating table using the autopsy scalpel, an autopsy readout paper will spawn on top of the body after a medium delay.

This paper contains several pieces of incredibly useful information: a best-guess at what weapon caused the most damage to the body, if one exists, and a brain scan listing **two masks from the current masquerade set: one is the dead body's true mask, and one is randomly selected.** If either the true or random mask is non-crew, it will be listed abstractly as simply "enemy of the crew".

This process removes the brain from the body, which may then be used for any purpose the Coroner sees fit. An autopsy cannot be performed on a body without a brain, and a non-Coroner cannot perform an autopsy.

The gameplay impact of this is significant: a non-hidden information role means the Coroner is implicitly trustable, and it also means that the Coroner might have an actual reason to lie--such as being a [Traitor](../masks/traitors.md). It also means that the Coroner's ability is more consistent round-to-round, and can be relied upon to an extent, which is useful for encouraging deductive gameplay. Since the autopsy is exclusively post-death, the Coroner's ability cannot be used to gain especially advantageous information to use against others--only to confirm deductions which were otherwise unconfirmable.

Because the Coroner's readout is on a piece of paper, this can be used to confirm their autopsies--assuming you actually saw the autopsy happen. The paper is forgeable otherwise, and editable.

## Quirked Up Weird Guy

The Coroner is, by their nature as someone who primarily converses with the dead, a bit of an oddball. Their clothing matches this fact--donning a trenchcoat and strange hat--and their autopsy scalpel is quite threatening to be at the other end of, if you offend the Coroner's eccentric sensibilities.

Though the Coroner's main purpose may seem to be autopsies, managing the dead and the morgue is actually quite a useful task. Most Medical Doctors worth their salt will be busy actually trying to save the living, and this leaves corpses in a weird spot where they are mostly ignored. Since the Coroner is tasked specifically with making sure they're managed properly, it should inject some interesting social gameplay and reduce the incidence of potentially silly interactions (excessive corpse looting). Furthermore, the task of moving and sorting through bodies, picking apart their gear, determining their cause of death, and interring the corpse can be quite satisfying on its own.

Even though you might find them repulsive or suspicious, keeping the Coroner around is extremely important: a non-Coroner cannot perform an autopsy, so their death is meaningful.
