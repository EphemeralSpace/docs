# Design Principles

The following are the set of core design pillars for **Ephemeral Space**.
These principles are meant to underscore all parts of the game: as such, any mechanic or element in the game must—at minimum—abide by all principles listed.

## Social Interaction
Ephemeral Space is first and foremost a multiplayer game.
While there is obviously a host of simulation and game mechanics underneath it, everything should tie into the core experience of interacting with others.

There should not be elements of the game which exist solely to engage individuals playing in an isolated manner.
Furthermore, cooperative play should be actively encouraged through both positive and negative incentives.

## Ambiguous Game State
The experience of Ephemeral Space is heavily built upon systems where individuals are not aware of the allegiance or motives of others.
Similarly, mechanics should always strive to create ambiguous situations for players to interface with.

Things should never have a simple origin or a single way of occuring.
Obvious 'tells' should always be avoided.

In general, a player should never be able to walk into a situation and be able to instantly deduce how it occured.

## Continuous Decay
A round of Ephemeral Space should always be on a constant trend towards a final point.
Players should always have goals and failure conditions and the game should always be moving towards one or both of them.

The state of a round should never be predicated upon individual players accomplishing things within a round.
Regardless of the actions of any given player, the round should still move forward and eventually terminate in a reasonable amount of time.

## Simulationist Design
Gameplay should try to revolve around natural emergent elements of the simulation rather than individually design mechanics.
Rather than discrete piece of "content", jobs and different parts of the game should be centered around more natural interactions with the environment.

When possible, try to build things that interface with the sandbox of the game.
Things that broadly interface with other elements can create emergent interactions that offer more depth than self-contained systems.
