## Concept
"Vote for someone to lynch" is a staple of social deduction games in this genre, so what happens to our off-the-beaten-path experience if we simply slap a tangentally related mechanic into it?

This is normally not a good idea, but it's likely to significantly change the dynamic when it comes to how the crew handle potentially antagonistic forces, making them knowing your identity *quite* dire.

## Gameplay
Every five(?) minutes, a lynch vote should be called listing every living member of crew by **name**, and an abstain option. Crew then publicly vote on who to lynch, and when the vote timer runs out the target, if any, is immediately gibbed.
As this mechanic is name based, crew have to actually know the names of the culprits to reliably lynch them. Votes work on majority basis and when a majority is reached they should end automatically.

Jesters affected by this mechanic should turn on the crew as a whole, or otherwise engage with it, to avoid cheesing them. (Phantom could become anti-crew, Martyr could doom the person who made the deciding vote.)
