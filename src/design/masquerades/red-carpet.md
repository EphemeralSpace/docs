## Concept
VIPs get a lot of leverage and trust due to their "safe" status, so what happens if we make a huge fraction of the crew into VIPs? 

## Gameplay
Red Carpet has the VIP and Crewmember as it's default masks, alongside ensuring at least 3 VIPs very early on to maximize the effect. While it is mostly a standard traitors experience, it relies on people being familiar with what that looks like so they second guess themselves upon seeing what's happening.

## Meta-game impact
Aside from demonstrating the weakness in trusting VIPs to people in the round (card theft is a real issue), red carpet significantly narrows down what masquerades could be in play, as having as many VIPs as it does is statistically unlikely.
