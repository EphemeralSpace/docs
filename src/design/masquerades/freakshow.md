# Freakshow

{{#template ../../templates/implemented.md }}

> **Name:** Freakshow
>
> **Troupes:** [Crew](../masks/crew.md)
>
> **Description:** A mid-high chaos masquerade focused only on high noise crew roles like jesters, freaks, etc.

## Concept
Freakshow is intended to be "surprise extended", with chaos levels similar to a [Traitors](traitors.md) round while having no traitors actually included.

## Gameplay
Freakshow should look and feel like a traitors round at the start without actually having any true antagonists to drive it, and should pack in a large number of noisy masks like [martyr](../masks/crew/martyr.md), [mercenary](../masks/crew/mercenary.md), [cannibal](../masks/crew/cannibal.md), and other antagonist-imitating picks. 

## Meta-game impact
Freakshow is intended to make people second-guess if traitors are even present in a round at all, adding further deniability for them to leverage if they keep their behavior clean of hard tells. This relies on freakshow being similarly chaotic to a traitors round, so strong troublemaker masks are necessary.

## Remarks
As written, with the masks currently in the game, freakshow is not terribly interesting. How do we fix this?
