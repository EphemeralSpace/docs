# Showdown

{{#template ../../templates/implemented.md }}

> **Name:** Showdown
>
> **Troupes:** [Crew](../masks/crew.md), [Traitors](../masks/traitors.md)
>
> **Description:** A high-chaos masquerade focused on excessive gun violence and a heavily armed crew.

## Concept
Showdown aims to ensure everyone on station is or can be armed, allowing for large fire fights and more at-scale conflict between the two troupes.

## Gameplay
Showdown features a larger-than-normal traitor loadout, alongside an excess of gun-equipped crew like [mercenaries](../masks/crew/mercenary.md) and [arms dealers](../masks/crew/arms-dealer.md) to ensure the crew has enough firepower to match. Due to the ability for the troupes to mutually wipe each-other with firepower, crew and traitors should fight more often than normal and in larger groups, leading to more intense if snowball-y gameplay.
