## Concept
The default role is Matchmaker, and the win objective is to make a maximally large polycule so that everyone can win together and nobody has to Violence. The game automatically ends when only one troupe remains, or all players are part of the same polycule.

## Gameplay
Crew should spend their initial five minutes wisely in an attempt to coordinate a massive polycule. If they fail, all polycules are liable to die quite quickly, ending the round when the remaining troupe wins.

## Meta-game impact
None, this masquerade is vote only and is an extremely silly alternate mode.
