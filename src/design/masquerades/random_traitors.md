# Random (Traitors)
A simple masquerade designed to imitate the pre-masquerades randomized experience, it should be relatively rare with a balanced traitor to pop ratio. All crew, even latejoiners, should be given a random mask. While this isn't particularly balanced, having it helps ensure it's harder to pin down the exact masquerade in play (Is it red carpet, or are we just in hell) and may also lead to (rare) good random mask selections that can inspire new masquerades.
