> **Description:** A purely random traitors round.

## Concept
A fully random selection of masks focused on traitors as the main antagonistic force.

## Gameplay
Roughly, the same as the [Traitors masquerade](../masquerades/traitors.md) with much higher variance on crew masks.

## Meta-game impact
Random can, in theory, look like a majority of masquerades without actually being any of them. While this isn't *likely*, it does mean you can't entirely eliminate possibilities, just be quite certain.
