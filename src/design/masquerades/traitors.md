## Concept
Traitors should serve as a reference for what a decent crew vs traitors masquerade looks like, and as the most common of the bunch for those masquerades. 

## Gameplay
Traitors should feel steadily paced, with a smattering of antagonistic crew masks, a couple oracles, and a "fair" (see [Masquerade Implementation](../../coding/masquerade-implementation.md) for up-to-date opinions here) traitor to crew ratio without being too exceptional as a mode. Traitors should not stand out significantly from other masquerades,
