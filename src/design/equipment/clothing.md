# Clothing

Clothing generally encompasses items worn by players for primarily aesthetic purposes.
While articles of clothing may have utility functions, their primary purpose is their appearance and the social impacts of that.

## Job Clothing

Job clothing refers to articles of clothing specifically related to a particular role on the station.
Players most often spawn with these clothes equipped, though supplemental accessories can spawn inside of lockers in departments.

The standing of the job should correlate with the complexity of the job's outfit.
Simple jobs like passengers, cargo techs, janitors, should have basic outfits that have only a few items associated with them.
More renowned jobs, like the Captain or Warden, can have more complicated outfits with additional components.

Clothing elements like capes or fancy hats should be reserved only for the absolute top-brass of the station.
Similarly, having multiple options for a slot should e reserved for only the highest roles.
While the captain can have two jumpsuits, someone like a doctor shouldn't.

### Accessing Job Clothes

A role's clothing should not be obtainable outside their area on the station, though you should not necessarily need access to acquire it.
A scientist's clothing may be inside of science, but the wardrobe or dressers that contain them should not be locked by access.

While more complex tools and resources can be secured, clothing should be fairly easy to acquire for the purposes of deception, social engineering, or drip-hunting.

### Reusing Articles of Clothing

While some aspects of an outfit are tailored to a job, the number of specific named elements should be kept to a minimum.

For example, instead of having specific "passenger sneakers" and "cargo tech kicks", opt to simply have a single pair of shoes that suit both jobs.
Reducing the number of similar clothing items helps simplify imitating an outfit.

## Fluff Clothing

Fluff encompasses all clothing that isn't directly associated with a specific role.
To avoid accumulating excessive fluff clothing, it must meet the following conditions:
- The clothing must have a unique theme or aesthetic
- The clothing must have a unique mechanic associated with it

Fluff clothing should always try to be meaningfully distinct from existing clothing.
New items should refrain from recoloring or mildly riffing on existing assets.
