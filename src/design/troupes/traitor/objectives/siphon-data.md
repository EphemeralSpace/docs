Siphon Data is an objective involving the siphoning of important data from various consoles.
Though usually not as fundamentally weighty as other objectives, like the [Bug Department](./bug-department.md) objective, it acts as a time game for traitor's final objective. Unlike Bug Department, however, it is significantly lower impact.

## Gameplay
Traitors with a Siphon Data objective have an innate verb that they can use on any machine that's their target. Using the verb on an machine with its panel open will trigger a doafter that plants a data siphoning device in to the machine.

Once the siphoning device is planted, the machine will begin to malfunction and start sparking & making strange sounds when in very close (1-tile) proximity of the machine.
Additionally, anyone who examines the machine while the panel is still open will be able to tell that it's been tampered with, and can remove the siphoning device if they see it.

After 8~ (vauge estimate) minutes have passed since planting the bug AND the bug has not been removed, a degredation event will be triggered corresponding to the type of machine that was hacked, and the objective will be marked as complete.

This behavior is more-or-less shared with the bugging behavior of the [Bug Department.](./bug-department.md) objective.

## Target Design
Siphon Data can be seen as a counterpart to the Sabotage objective, and its objectives should be designed as such - which is to say, mainly focused around siphoning data from important machinery, like the Medical Records or Criminal Records.
The consideration for if something should be a sabotage or siphon objective is mainly up to theming & variety, but balancing is not an irrelevant concern.
Objectives that have inconvienent properties or placements for siphoning should likely have sabotage objectives - such as telecomms servers, which are hidden away in their own room and make loud sounds, which would make the effects of Siphon hard to notice.

## Why
In addition to acting as an interesting variation on Sabotage, Siphon Data also encourages more creative strategies and systems interaction then Sabotage typically does, due to the slow-burn nature.
Players might consider things like causing chaos as distractions against their objectives, bunkering their objective down heavily in order to ensure the bug isn't removed before the time limit is up, or even dragging the offending console away in to maintenance, if they can get away with it.
