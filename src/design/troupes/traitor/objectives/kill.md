# Kill

{{#template ../templates/partially-implemented.md}}

> *ATTENTION, OPERATIVE. The captain is carrying valuable corporate secrets about the Syndicate that would compromise your mission. Make absolutely certain that they're dead before you arm the nuclear warhead.*

## Gameplay
Kill objectives only select members of Command and Security.

Once the correct target listed in the objective is killed, the objective will be marked as complete.

## Why
Killing is not only an interesting action with a lot of plausible denaibility, but also makes a lot of thematic sense for traitors, and pushes them in to being scarier then they otherwise would be.

The barriers to *who* is selected as a kill target makes the action inherintly more suspicious (i.e "why are you the captain,) and also makes the likelyhood of the target randomly dying a lot less likely.
