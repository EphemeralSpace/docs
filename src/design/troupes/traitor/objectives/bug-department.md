# Bug Department

{{#template ../../../templates/unimplemented.md }}

> *ATTENTION, OPERATIVE. The crew of Space Station 14 are on high alert. We have determined that it is critical that you infect the station's security systems as a distraction before detonating the nuclear warhead.*

Bug Department involves inducing a greytide virus in a given department.
It is a timed objective like [Siphon Data,](./siphon-data.md) meaning it slows down the pace of the game and gives crew more opprutunities to react the traitor's actions.

## Gameplay
Traitors with a Bug Department objective have an innate verb to plant a bug in any APC that's in the room of a beacon associated with that department, provided its panel is open.

Once the siphoning device is planted, the machine will begin to malfunction and start sparking & making strange sounds when in very close (1-tile) proximity of the machine.
Additionally, anyone who examines the machine while the panel is still open will be able to tell that it's been tampered with, and can remove the siphoning device if they see it.

After 8~ (vauge estimate) minutes have passed since planting the bug AND the bug has not been removed, a greytide virus will be triggered corresponding to the type of machine that was hacked, and the objective will be marked as complete.

This behavior is more-or-less shared with the data siphoning behavior of the [Siphon Data](./siphon-data.md) objective.

## Why
Being basically an APC-focused variant of [Siphon Data,](./siphon-data.md) the reasoning for its inclusion is more-or-less the same.
The slow-burn nature of this objective creates interesting counterplay & strategy from both traitors and crew, encouraging them to create distractions to make their suspicious behavior less likely to be found.
It also acts as more plausible deniability, since the behavior is shared with the greytide virus, and ends up creating more tension because of it.
