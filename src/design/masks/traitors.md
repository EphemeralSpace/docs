# Traitors

{{#template ../../templates/unimplemented.md }}

Traitors are a troupe of masks focused on utilizing subterfuge to further their objectives.
Although every traitor mask receives a unique set of equipment, their primary strength is their ability to identify each other and work together to accomplish their objectives.

As a threat, they are meant to be an omnipresent source of paranoia.
Truly determining if someone is a traitor is extremely difficult, as most of their equipment has heavy overlap with generic items that can be acquired on-station.
Ultimately, operatives are meant to push the limits deceit and taking advantage of your environment.

## Equipment
To assist in completing their objectives, all traitors are told of the location of a hidden item cache in maintenance, containing illicit equipment related that varies depending on their mask.
For example, one mask might get a gun and some ammo, while one another might get a chameleon kit, voice mask, and agent ID.

The items in these caches are largely intended to be static in function, though there may be minor variance (i.e you get a pistol instead of a revolver.)

While the more powerful rare items in each cache should be immediately identifiable as traitor gear, the more common general equipment should have greater overlap.
This is so that, while finding a core piece of someone's kit is a tell, simply seeing someone fire a gun or blow up a structure doesn't immediately identify them.

## Objectives
All players in the traitor troupe, regardless of mask type, share a pool objectives, reminiscent of traditional space station traitor objectives.
These objectives can be things like:
- Kill X players
- Kill a specific player
- Steal an important item (needs to be something actually useful, and something that isn't just on someone 24/7)

While these objectives are dynamic and can vary in what they request from round-to-round, one objective is static and omni-present: the detonation of the station's nuke.
Upon completing the non-nuke-related objectives, players will recieve a secondary, targetted drop pod shipment of powerful items (such as Energy Swords or Blood-Red Hardsuits,) and the nuke disk's tracker.
These are to help with the next "phase" of traitor gameplay: the nuke detonation phase.

The nuke is, obviously, non-trivial to detonate and requires a few prerequisites; namely, the acesss codes, and the nuclear authentication disk.
While the disk is on station & you *do* have a tracking device for it, not even the captain has the access codes.
The syndicate *does* have them, however, there's one thing stopping them from sending them: the various **cryptographic communications towers** littered across the station (these will be elaborated on in the next section.)

## Destroy the Pylons
There are a handful of cryptographic communications towers that are littered around the station in secure areas.
They act as a sort of generic gameplay macguffin for any antagonist that needs some kind of limiting mechanic.
In the case of traitors here, they are blocking the syndicate from sending in the nuke codes to the traitors.
They act as an additional buffer for the nuke, and as a sign that things have probably reached a boiling point.

## Detonation

The final capstone to the round is to detonate the station nuke.
Unless this is done, the traitors can only receive--at best--a partial victory for the completion of their other objectives.

This serves as a final standoff between the traitors and the rest of the station.
In the event that everything prior was happening in the background without anyone noticing, this offers a final point at which everyone must work together to beat the other side.
