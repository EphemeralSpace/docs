# Recruit

{{#template ../../../templates/implemented.md }}

> **Name:** Recruit
>
> **Troupe:** [Traitor](https://github.com/EphemeralSpace/docs/blob/master/src/design/masks/traitors.md)
>
> **Description:** Help out the traitors that converted you.
>
> **Objectives:** The same ones every traitor gets.

## Concept
The Recruit is the mask granted to a player that has been converted in to a syndicate agent mid-round. Naturally, since this mask is gained midround, they don't get access to any of the special gear traitors normally get from their hidden gear caches. This generally makes the recruit much weaker compared to their peers.

## Abilities
The Recruit has no special traits or abilities.

## Gameplay
The recruit's goal is to help out the people the traitor team in any way they can. Since the recruit starts with no special gear, they'll need to rely on any station-side supplies they can scrounge up.
