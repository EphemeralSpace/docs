# Marauder

{{#template ../../templates/unimplemented.md }}

> **Name: Marauder**
>
> **Troupe:** [Traitor](https://github.com/EphemeralSpace/docs/blob/master/src/design/masks/traitors.md)
>
> **Description:** Engage in loud, brute force assasinations and combat.
>
> **Objectives:** The same ones every traitor gets

## Concept
The marauder has the most blunt offensive offering of all traitor masks. Their powerful offense allows them to have a significant advantage in combat, however, they are lacking in the inherint utility present in other masks's kits. This kit offers a novel playstyle compared to other traitor masks (which are usually focused on stealth & sabotage,) while hopefully being a generally infrequent enough archetype as to not sway the pendulum of traitor in to being a fully offensive assault on the station.

## Abilities
The marauder starts with a random smallarm, a few spare magazines of ammunition, an armor vest, and 2 grenades.

## Gameplay
Players fighting the marauder should remain aware of their powerful offense, however, their starting resources are inherintly limited, making any significant killing sprees a challenge.
