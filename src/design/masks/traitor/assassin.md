## Concept
The assassin's kit is tailor-made for stealthy assasinations. Their silenced pistol and hypopen make them all-but-garunteed to pick off their target under the correct conditions. Despite the assasin's strengths, their kit lack sustainability and raw power, making them quite weak offensively when pushed.

## Abilities
The assasin starts with a silenced pistol, a spare magazine of ammo, and 2-or-so hypopens filled with some sedating agent.

The hypopen is a one-time-use hypospray injector in a concealed, pen-size form factor. Using it on the target injects them with a chemical that knocks them out after a few seconds, giving them time to react - you'll need to use the pen in a secluded place for it to be properly effective.

## Gameplay
The assassin's specialty in silent murder makes them a frightening presence. Anyone in their crosshairs could easily perish from one maintenance trip gone south. Fortunately, the assassin's low sustainability makes them pretty much only useful for killing one or two people, and their activities leaves behind some hard-to-dispose of evidence, so they're not infalleable.
