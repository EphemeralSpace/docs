>
> **Objectives:** The same ones every traitor gets

## Concept
The spy is primarily focused on complete evasion. Using their stealth suit's invisibility, they're capable of sneaking in to almost anywhere they want, provided they have the battery charge to do so. This gives them immense flexibility, however, they are more or less completely lacking much of anything outside of their middling knife.

## Abilities
The spy starts with a wearable stealth suit, and a knife.

The stealth suit functions similarly to the spy's invisibility watch from *Team Fortress 2.* Players will need to use an action to activate the suit's invisibility powers, slowly cloaking them to 0% opacity. While in the cloaked state, the player is invisible, cannot act, and the suit's internal power cell will drain. The suit's cell is self-recharging and cannot be removed. Running in to cloaked players causes their cloak to "shimmer" for a second, briefly revealing their presence.

## Gameplay
This mask plays similarly to other masks based around stealth, like the [assassin](design/masks/traitor/assassin.md) or [infiltrator](design/masks/traitor/infiltrator.md). The existence of a stealthy threat creates paranoia in the crew - a key goal of traitor mode. The invisibility suit is also very interesting and has a lot of potential fun interactions - players might drive themselves insane and waste ammo trying to find an invisible spy in maintenance, or the spy might have to improvise after getting hit by an EMP grenade that temporarily drained the spy's suit power.
