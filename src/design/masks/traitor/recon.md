{{#template ../../templates/unimplemented.md }}

> **Name: Recon**
>
> **Troupe:** [Traitor](https://github.com/EphemeralSpace/docs/blob/master/src/design/masks/traitors.md)
>
> **Description:** Use your special items to gain intel. Relay your intel to other traitors or use it to act at the perfect time.
>
> **Objectives:** The same ones every traitor gets

## Concept
The overall goal of the recon is generally to use their enhanced information access to help them make better decisions, and evade consequence. Their thermal goggles, chameleon projector, and camera bug are about as good as you can get when it comes to information gathering. Being entirely information-based, the recon promotes an interesting supportive playstyle not really seen in other traitor masks, while also allowing for open-ended individualist gameplay. Though they completely lack any offense, they are more then equipped to be able to get better gear to do other things.


The recon's kit is all about using their informational items to act at the perfect time. Their thermal goggles, chameleon projector, and camera bug are about as good as you can get when it comes to this - the projector is great for blending in while gathering info with your camera bug, which let you effectively look in to any area you want on the map at any time. The thermal goggles are also extremely useful for passive information gathering, such as locations of opponents during a chase. The recon will need to be careful, though - if they're caught out, the only thing they can really use is the chameleon projector, which is obvious and unreliable. They're completely lacking in any default combat abilities, so they will need to seek out better items on the station (which is significantly helped by their information gathering items.)

## Abilities
The recon starts with thermal goggles, a camera bug, and a chameleon projector.

The thermal goggles are an item that lets you see players through walls.

## Gameplay
Beyond their own self-motivated gameplay, the recon acts as an interesting game piece for both traitors and players. In addition to providing information to their own team, if the recon is stopped, their items can be weaponized against traitors, or used by other actors not affiliated with the crew. Maybe the security officer gets them to start hunting traitors... or maybe a fake security officer gets the goggles and uses them to "hunt traitors," only to actually be using them to find their kill target. The recon may need to play extra carefully in order to ensure their items do not get in to the wrong hands.
