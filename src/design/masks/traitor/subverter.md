# Subverter

{{#template ../../templates/unimplemented.md }}

> **Name:** Subverter
>
> **Troupe:** [Traitor](https://github.com/EphemeralSpace/docs/blob/master/src/design/masks/traitors.md)
>
> **Description:** Assassinate people & recruit them in to your troupe.
>
> **Objectives:** The same ones every traitor gets.

## Concept
The Subverter's goal is to murder people with what few tools they have, followed by usuing their brainwashing microchip to turn them in to a traitor.

## Abilities
The Subverter only starts with a knife, and two brainwashing microchips.

The brainwashing microchip is an item that only works on dead players. When used on a dead player, it will adrenaline-revive them at low health (similar to other masks like the [parasite](../crew/parasite.md) or the [daredevil](../daredevil.md) and introduce them in to the traitor troupe as a "recruit," which is a mask that has same objectives as all other traitors; it only exists as a way to communicate to the player that they weren't a round-start traitor.

## Gameplay
The Subverter has a lot of interesting, granular strategy that can be employed on their side. Since your microchips are limited, you might want to save your chip for an important target - or maybe you just give it to the first person you see, out of desperation, since you're losing and need to enact a desperate play.
The Subverter also acts as an interesting element of social intruige, since someone you may have known before as an ally could mysteriously become subverted. This (hopefully) won't intrude on the design space of any other future conversion antagonists, as this is fairly limited and different in application compared to what those usually try to accomplush.
