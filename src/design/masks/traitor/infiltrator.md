> **Name: Infiltrator**
>
> **Troupe:** [Traitor](https://github.com/EphemeralSpace/docs/blob/master/src/design/masks/traitors.md)
>
> **Description:** Decieve people with your chameleon kit. Break in to places.
>
> **Objectives:** The same ones every traitor gets

## Concept
The infiltrator's kit is centered around abusing the identity system. The chameleon kit allows them to appear to take on the identity of anyone at notice, making them a master at deception & escaping the consequences of their actions. Furthering this, their doorjack gives them additional utility, allowing them to break in to areas quickly & get out, hopefully without needing to arouse any suspicsion aimed at their true identity. To make up for their powerful special items, they lack any real offensive capability.

## Abilities
The infiltrator starts with a chameleon kit and a doorjack.

## Gameplay
The chameleon kit of the infiltrator makes them a uniquely paranoia-inducing threat. The person you're talking to could easily have a fake identity, or otherwise steal the identity of someone real. While they can be "checked" by asking them to reveal their true identity, or by looking for bolted open doors - how often will you reasonably be able to do that? Players will need to remain diligent when they know the infiltrator is in play to avoid falling to their scheme.
