## Concept
A "traitor" with the ability to select what side they're on every few minutes, completely changing their troupe and objectives. 
They're a *very* strong information mask as a result, and can gather quite a lot of team info in their effort to win.

## Abilities
The turncoat gets an action, once every ten minutes, that gives them 30 seconds to decide on a side (or do nothing, in which case they stay in the troupe they're already in and must wait another 10 minutes).
Upon entering a troupe, they get everything a member of that troupe would. In particular, as a traitor they know who other traitors are and vice versa.

## Gameplay
The turncoat is the Ultimate Liability for both parties, bolstering whichever side they think will win and potentially spilling very potent information.
While the information from them is difficult to *prove* (They can, of course, simply lie.), and they can simply play with whichever side they want.

Being a strong information source also paints a solid target on their back, if the traitors have reason to believe the turncoat is betraying them, they have no reason to avoid killing them.
Same philosophy applies to the crew, should the turncoat reveal themselves. This puts the turncoat in a *very* tough position where their information *can* be useful, but they may opt to never
speak of any of it in order to prioritize living.

# Remarks
They may be better off as a neutral/independent mask, requiring them to decide on a team at round start to get any information, but the impact of this is minor and it may be better to start them off in an advantageous troupe (Traitors) by default.
