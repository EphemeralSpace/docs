## Concept

The Demolitionist's kit has many facets: conspicuous entry into secure locations (a hot commodity), explosives useful both for murder and property destruction, and a trap card for when things really go south.

## Abilities

The Demolitionist starts with the following items in their cache:
- 2-3 pieces of C4 explosive
- 2 minibombs or strong grenades (something of that caliber)
- A macrobomb implant

The macrobomb should not be an especially huge explosion, and should, at most, be able to hull breach 1 tile. It should have a radius of 3-5 tiles--large enough to kill or severely maim people in striking range and destroy nearby walls, but small enough to be evaded simply by shooting at the Demolitionist from a distance. It should also not immediately activate on death--instead, beeping a few times and exploding after ~1 second. Succumbing should trigger the explosion, but simply suiciding should not.

## Gameplay

Though the Demolitionist has very broad utility in completing pretty much any objective, their lack of a firearm or other direct method of killing makes them reliant on others in their troupe, and they may end up divvying out some of their gear to others. C4 is relatively deniable, since Engineering spawns with some, but the Demolitionist must be much more careful with using their other items.

Their macrobomb implant may be the Demolitionist's most interesting characteristic: it means they function as a sort of traitor-jester, punishing those who kill carelessly (especially Security, incentivizing at the very least arresting first), soft-confirming their traitor status, and allowing for a great deal of intentional strategy: suicide bombing, baiting kills, last-ditch nuke defense tactics or distractions, etc. The macrobomb triggering only after a short delay and not triggering on direct suicide reduces a lot of obvious cheese with the mechanic.

On a more base simulationist level, there aren't very many sources of explosions right now, and the Demolitionist provides many, which enhances repair gameplay and overall station degradation.

The Demolitionist should not ever spawn as the only member of their troupe (owing to their lack of immediate firepower), and there should rarely ever be more than one Demolitionist per squad.
