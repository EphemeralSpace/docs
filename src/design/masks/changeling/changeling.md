## Abilities

### Transformation
The most obvious of these - the ability intended to act as the primary draw of the troupe - is their ability to transform in to & take on the appearance of other crew members they have killed.
To do this, the changeling needs to "absorb" a player who is dead or in crit, requiring a long doafter. Doing this leaves the body with obvious signs that it was absorbed, meaning the crew will likely eventually know they are in play if they become too active.

Overall, transformation helps strengthen social deduction & paranoia aspects of the game in a very significant way.
Just from the changeling's *existence,* when the signs & callouts start emerging, players will likely immediately become more on-edge.
When something as fundamental as identity is uncertain, you can never really know who is good or not through any means other then their direct observable actions - at which point, it may be too late for you.
Players are both encouraged to work together *and* be more untrustworthy of eachother, playing in to the friction the game's social interaction thrives off of.

### Armblade
Another very core part of the changeling's kit. Using the armblade ability transforms one of the user's arms in to a powerful armblade, rendering it unusable for anything but hurting people until the ability is toggled again.
The armblade is very obvious, but very strong. It's absolutely fantastic at killing isolated targets, especially when combined with the stings.

This ability gives changelings an obvious means to an end to initiate their absorb ability, and makes them significantly more scary to engage with in isolated scenarios.

### Reviving Stasis
Changelings cannot die through traditional means. When dead, they have the ability to enter a reviving stasis, acting as a weak adrenaline-revive of sorts, putting them on their feet, abliet in a rough state.
To properly dispose of a changeling, you must completely destroy the body - be it through gibbing, cremation, or other methods.

This ability forces players to make a concerted effort to dispose of changelings, and makes them significantly more frightening to go up against, further strengthening the core themes of the troupe.
It also helps them mitigate frustration from getting randomly killed by environmental hazards, which is useful since they will certainly want to utilize lots of them when aiming to force the radstorm.

### Stings
The sting is a togglable ability that allows the user to afflict some kind of ailment on to another player in interaction range. The ability has a fairly long, several-minute long cooldown, so make sure to use it wisely.
The effect of the ability randomly varies per each changeling. Typically, stings inflict some kind of effect analagous to what chemicals usuaully do (blindness, mute, sleep, cold, etc,) but this doesn't nessecarily have to be the case.

The sting acts as a supplementary element to the rest of the changeling's kit, strengthening their profficency at picking off isolated targets (useful for making them even *more* paranoia inducing,) and allowing for more interesting teamwork within the troupe.
Additionally, the sting acts as a designer lever, acting as an interface to allow changelings to become more integrated in to other systems.
