# Crew

{{#include ../../templates/unimplemented.md }}

The crew is a troupe that serves as the "default" state for typical gameplay.
While every crew mask shares the same win condition, they are not stringently aligned like [traitors](traitors.md).

Whereas most troupes are a small number of closely-aligned players working together, the crew embodies a more diverse range of motivations.
What they lack in coordination is made up for in number, as there will (hopefully) be enough good people to secure victory.

## Ambiguity

Crew masks, beyond personal incentives, largely exist to create ambiguity for antagonistic actions on the station.
Although their secondary objectives may encourage some level of aggressive or destructive behavior, the main goal that unites all members of the troupe ensures at least some level of cooperative play.

A noteworthy element about the crew troupe is that none of them are able to really "confirm" one another, at least not as readily as other troupes may be able to.
While they are still generally trustworthy due to their high number (the average player is likely to always be a crew member) it does call into question if you can truly be sure someone is on your side.

## Objective

The main objective of the crew lies within the science department: the Portal Generator.
This massive machine is capable of instantly teleporting objects across space, and it's the teams way to victory, if they can charge it up.

Succeeding in telescience is meant to be a largely hands-off process.
As the sorta gameplay default, the crew are positioned to win so long as they keep things running and prevent other troupes from winning.
So long as minimum effort is exerted, the crew should always be able to win.
The crew entirely failing is more of a default case in the event of something catastrophic that would otherwise stall the round.

## Telescience
In order to win, the crew must charge up the portal generator before the end of the round.
This is done passively through simply supplying it with constant power.
Note that, while this is relatively low skill, it can still be (temporarily) sabotaged: either by cutting power supply or destroying components of the portal generator.

At regular intervals while charging up, the machine will pause until a random **Portal Event** is completed.
Portal Events are activated through a console attached to the portal generator itself, which must be manually run by someone on-site.

Starting the event will immediately allow the portal generator to continue charging, but it will also spawn a threat somewhere on the station.
These threats fulfill the same purpose as a traditional midround antagonist: they escalate the chaos within the round and provide clear targets for the station to rally against.
Keep in mind that, while these are _akin_ to midrounds, they are not _literally_ midrounds.
A portal event can pull in strange aliens, dangerous anomalies, or even teleport in chunks of another world.

Once the charge has completely filled up (taking the duration of an average round), the portal generator will be able to activate once more, teleporting the station out of danger and starting the evacuation sequence and ending the round.
