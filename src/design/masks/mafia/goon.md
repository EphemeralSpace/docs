## Concept
The goon is the most basic member of the mafia, and mirror the [recruit](../traitor/recruit.md) of the traitor troupe.
While you cannot spawn as a goon, any crew role is able to become a goon by accepting the [godfather's](godfather.md) offer to join the mafia.

## Abilities
The goon is the last in line to promote into the godfather

## Gameplay
Goons are the basic soldiers of the mafia and serve as a low level inductees into the troupe.
While playing as a goon is not substantially different from any other member of the mafia, the interest comes in the fact that becoming a goon is a voluntary conversion.
Since goons lose in the event of a mafia loss, prospective Mafiosos are encouraged to weigh the state of the mafia versus the state of the crew before joining.
This creates a system where if the mafia appears to be in bad shape, players might stay away in fear of both losing their mask as failing as part of the mafia troupe.
