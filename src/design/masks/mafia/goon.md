## Concept
The goon is the most basic member of the mafia, and mirror the [recruit](../traitor/recruit.md) of the traitor troupe.
While you cannot spawn as a goon, any crew role is able to become a goon by accepting the [Godfather's]() offer to join the mafia.
As a goon, your goal is to beat up your target so you can promote into a [capo](capo.md).

## Abilities
The goon has no special abilities.

## Gameplay
Goons are the basic soldiers of the mafia and serve as a transitionary point in the growth of the troupe's power.
Since they do not progress the mafia's goals until they complete their job, goons are incentivized to work with other mafia members to complete their hits.

This ties into the progression of the troupe, as it forces a baseline level of conflict while the mafia completes their objectives.
Consequently, goons must be careful, as their violence is likely to bring a baseline level of suspicion onto them that other members of the mafia might not otherwise have.
