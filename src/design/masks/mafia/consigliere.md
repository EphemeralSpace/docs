## Concept
The consigliere is the third-in-command of the mafia and is focused on supplying information to the various members of the mafia.
While they are technically able to fight and are even supplied a sidearm, their position as an upper member of the mafia means they're unlikely to be engaging in direct combat.

## Abilities
The consigliere starts with thermal goggles that allow them to see players through walls, a camera bug, a silenced pistol, and a master encryption key.
Note that only the _first_ consigliere will receive this.

The consigliere promotes into the [underboss](underboss.md).
If the consigliere dies, a new one will be promoted from a [capo](capo.md).

## Gameplay
The consigliere is based around information gameplay that compromises the otherwise much-stronger security team and gives the mafia an upper-hand.
Since the mafia is often going to be heavily outnumbered early in a round, it's important to keep tabs on security to ensure that they don't try and raid the mafia base.
Additionally, even if security sneaks up on them, the thermal goggles and other supplies allows the consigliere to assess the situation and execute the most effective plan of defense or evasion.

The mask's less aggressive role also allows them to play a more cerebral role in the mafia compared to the more aggressive and loud goons and capos.
Rather than picking off people of interest, they can focus on grander strategy with other members of the mafia.
This gives them space to lead on new member recruitment, stakeouts, and other general sleuthy activities.
