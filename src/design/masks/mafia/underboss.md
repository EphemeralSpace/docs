## Concept
The underboss is the second-in-command in the mafia and is focused on aggressive combat maneuvers.
While they don't have the sheer firepower of the Godfather, their less-important position in the mafia opens them up for more aggressive play.

## Abilities
The underboss starts with a double-barrel shotgun, several boxes of buckshot and slugs, an armored vest, and a knife.
Note that only the _first_ underboss will receive this.

The underboss promotes into the [Godfather]().
If the underboss dies, a new one will be promoted from a [consigliere](consigliere.md) (or a [capo](capo.md) if unavailable).

## Gameplay
The underboss serves as a more visceral type of mafia mask that is focused on fighting security and taking heat off of the godfather.
Since outsiders aren't able to distinguish who is actually the true godfather, it may serve the underboss to pose as the boss, lulling the crew into a false sense of security while the true Godfather continues to work.
