## Concept
The capo serves as an "evolved" form of the [goon](goon.md), being the result of a goon completing their job from the boss.
Gaining capos are a win condition for the mafia, as they are the only replenishable senior member.

## Abilities
The capo promotes into the [consigliere]().

## Gameplay
Capos serve as the more-experienced soldiers of the troupe.
They are in most ways similar to goons, although they are less expendable due to their relation to the troupe objective.
Becoming a capo offers the potential to advance higher in the mafia, due to them being the first mask available to non-mafia members that is capable of promotion.
