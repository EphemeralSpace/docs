# Changelings

{{#template ../../templates/implemented.md }}

Changelings ("lings" for short) are a minor troupe focused on disrupting the station to the point where the radstorm is reached, ensuring that nobody else wins.
Using their innate biological abilties - stings, disguising capabilities, etc; they act as a frightening passive force that strikes fear in to the crew just by having their existence known.

Being a minor troupe, there are usually no more then 3 or so changelings present per round at the absolute max.
Unlike other troupes, there is also only a singular changeling mask.

## Abilities
THIS PART IS UNFINISHED WHICH IS WHY IT ENDS EARLY

Changelings have a wide range of abilities and tools to help them achieve their goal of being scary to engage with & capable of (metaphorically) bleeding out the crew if effort is not exerted on to dispatching them.
The reasoning for these is elaborated on more in the mask doc, but at a baseline, all changelings have the ability to transform in to other players they have absorbed

## Roundflow
As mentioned in the opening summary, the ultimate goal & win condition of changelings is to deliberately stall out the game to trigger the radstorm, ensuring a fail for all other troupes.
This is a very open-ended objective that naturally hooks in to many game systems & is very flexible in how it can be approached.
Notably, the main thing this does is push changelings to actively engage in sabotage that slows down the gamestate instead of furthering it, such as power sabotage, or aggressive atmos sabotage.

This is desirable for a multitude of reasons. The win condition of lings throws a universal wrench in to the game that all troupes must account for, leading to situations where players on opposing factions might have to temporarily band together to expel the changelings before they can do enough damage to make the troupe's objectives impossible to complete.
Likewise, the formidiable-ness and individual 1-on-1 combat power of lings makes them extremely paranoia-inducing to even think about when they are in play, feeding in to the ominous undertones of the game & making for memorable and tense moments.

As a rare alternative win condition (acting as a "speed up" when things get too slow,) changelings can also kill a large majority (90-95%~) of the crew to prematurely win.
This is not really a goal changelings should be striving to achieve unless the opprutunity presents itself - being obvious as a changeling in most cases should be a death scentence.
