## Concept
The Hitman is a mask that, similarly to the [Insider](./insider.md), receives a cache, containing a page giving clues pointing toward particular people on the station. Their objective is to kill the people their clues refer to.

## Abilities
No abilities beyond their cache.

## Gameplay
The Hitman serves as an evil counterpart to the Insider and other clue-based masks, making members of the crew think twice about freely revealing their hair or eye colour, providing cover for [Traitors](../traitors.md). As a result of this, the Hitman will likely act similarly to the Insider, with the exception of having to commit murder once the Hitman's figured out their targets.
