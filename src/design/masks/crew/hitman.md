## Concept
The Hitman is a mask that, similarly to the [Insider](./insider.md), receives a cache, containing dossiers each giving clues pointing toward a particular person on the station. Their objective is to identify, hunt down and kill the people their clues refer to, while still minimising other casualties in order to avoid sabotaging telescience beyond what is necessary. Due to the chaotic situation on-station, they might have to race against the Syndicate, serial killers, the environment and other murderous individuals in order to secure their paycheck.

## Abilities
No abilities beyond their cache, which contains one dossier with clues on it per target, like this:
```
Info on "Osaka":
Male
Blue hair
Red eyes
```
Their cache also contains a silenced 9mm pistol and a spare magazine, for carrying out the kills.
Each of their objectives refers to the respective codename in their dossier.

## Gameplay
The Hitman serves as an evil counterpart to the Insider and other clue-based masks, making members of the crew think twice about freely revealing their hair or eye colour, providing cover for [Traitors](../traitors.md).
As a result of this, the Hitman will likely act similarly to the Insider, with the exception of having to commit murder once the Hitman's figured out their targets.

Notably, unlike other crew killing masks like the [Veteran](./veteran.md) or [Avenger](./avenger.md), the Hitman will be committing murder unprovoked, meaning that randomly attacking a person is no longer practically a sure-fire tell of a person being a Traitor; an [Assassin](../traitor/assassin.md) who has hidden or used their knockout medipens may be able to pass themselves off as a Hitman, especially if they've prepared fake dossiers suitable for the Syndicate's targets.
Security will likely have to be more tolerant of unprovoked murderers in order to avoid losing the crew even more of their own. 

Additionally, despite their murderous intent, the Hitman is still a crew member who wants telescience done at the end of the day, meaning that despite the fact that they want a certain few people gone for whatever reason, they may end up being a valuable asset for the crew regardless once they're done... or find themselves facing the wrath of a [Phantom](./phantom.md), [Martyr](./martyr.md) or Avenger.
