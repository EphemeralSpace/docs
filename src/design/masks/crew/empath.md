## Concept
The empath is a mask that has the ability to gain insight into someone's mask, giving them the power to help convict or absolve others.
Although their ability does not give them the power to precisely pinpoint a mask, it can serve as a final piece of a puzzle, connecting disparate events and potentially catching people in a lie.

## Abilities
Their main ability is the power to sense the aura of a target player.
Which aura they see is dependent on the mask the player has, with each type corresponding roughly below:

- **Neutral Aura:** Neutral, unassuming. Default aura used for the majority of roles such as [Citizen](citizen.md), [Mercenary](mercenary.md), [Glutton](glutton.md), etc
- **Killing Intent:** Murderous, violent. Used for roles that have kill-related objectives, such as [Traitors](../traitors.md), [Animal Hater](animal-hater.md), [Veteran](veteran.md), etc
- **Strange Feeling:** Dull, hazy. Reserved for masks which have not gained their main objectives, such as the [Amnesiac](amnesiac.md) or Copier-type masks like the [Cannibal](cannibal.md)

This ability is not free, however.
After a small number of usages, every further use will incur a rising chance of causing permanent brain damage to the user.

## Gameplay
The empath is a mask that, while lacking objectives pushing them towards gameplay, is deeply involved with the deduction of the game due to their strong abilities.
Since the detection of an aura is not a sure-fire confirmation of being a member of an enemy troupe, it is a strong piece of evidence that can help seal the deal.
If combined with other clues deduced by a player's actions, it may give the station enough certainty to make a definitive decision.

## Variants
Variants for this mask tend to either improve or decrease the veracity of the auras sensed.
For example, a professional empath may be able to distinguish between a crew-aligned or traitor-aligned killing intent.
A dubious empath may give incorrect or useless reading, derived from insignificant characteristics rather than the target's mask (all gingers have a killing intent, passengers have a strange feeling, etc.)
