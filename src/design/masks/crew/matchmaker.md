## Concept
The matchmaker functions as an informed party for selecting Lovers, and Lovers are people who will thus either win together or die together depending on the whims of fate.

## Abilities
The Matchmaker can, at any point within the first five minutes, pick two players to match together as lovers.
If they do not pick, lovers are selected randomly.

Lovers have their win conditions tied together, and either lover winning results in both winning. For example, a crew and traitor could be lovers, and the crewmember can win with the traitors.

Objectives are not shared, and if there's only one winner out of the two lovers, the would be loser has their objectives nullified so they can win.

If either lover dies, the other lover immediately suicides, encouraging them to ensure one another's survival.

## Gameplay
The matchmaker, after using their ability, is a normal crew mask and the only thing interesting about them is knowing who their selected lovers are. The lovers do not know who the matchmaker is, and the matchmaker's only real evidence of being matchmaker is knowing who the lovers are.
