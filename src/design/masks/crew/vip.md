## Concept
The VIP is a mask that starts with a VIP card with their name on it. This card does nothing other then acting as a meta-confirmation that they're the VIP, as only the VIP can spawn with the card. They have no other special abilities or objectives.

## Abilities
See above section.

## Gameplay
The VIP acts as a sort of "soft-safe-check" and sets the stage for social intrigue relating to its card. For example, the VIP might use their card to confirm their innocence at a crucial time... or maybe, someone's stolen the VIP's card and is trying to use it to do the same, which acts as a seed for further social intrigue.
