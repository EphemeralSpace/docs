## Concept
The nobleman is a mask that must refrain from killing anyone.
If they do kill anyone, they will then die.

## Abilities
Upon killing someone, the nobleman will receive a [martyr-esque](../jester/martyr.md) notification that they've brought dishonor to themselves.
After a 5-minute delay, they will kill themselves in penance.

## Gameplay
The nobleman is a mask that is naturally conflict-averse due to the nature of their objective.
Since any resistance on their part could result in their death, they want to ensure that there are others around them to protect and fight for them.
This creates an interesting decision for command or security players, as they must forgo any traditional violent response, as it could almost certainly spell their doom.
Instead, they're forced to de-escalate situations nonviolently, ensuring that their hands stay clean.
