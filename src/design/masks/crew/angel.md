```admonish warning "Notes"
A couple notes:
- In order to facilitate basic communication with people in critical condition, I'd like some kind of mechanic where players in crit can hear whispers within 1 tile, and can whisper (albeit through labored breaths with some kind of hard-to-discern accent) within 1 tile to other players. This is a general thing--not tied to the Angel specifically, just something I think would be nice, but it would integrate well here and make things more interesting with blackmail scenarios and whatnot.
- It might make sense for Guesser-type masks to have to pick a correct mask out of a random list (of ~10) masks or so, to make things a bit more interesting and allow some educated guess-type deduction. Operate off of that assumption for other Guessers, I guess?
- We probably want a way to generically show a popup for players targeted by abilities like this, letting them know what happened?
```

## Concept

The Angel is a helpful Guesser-type mask with an objective to protect at least 1 guaranteed-crew-troupe player, and an ability that can heal others conditionally. This gives them a small edge over others in terms of useful information, the ability to learn more through correct guesses, and a way to directly help people that are in trouble, outside of the usual ways of doing so.

## Abilities

The Angel can target any player once. They must guess that player's mask, and if correct, will inject a sizeable dose of omnizine into that player, as well as adrenaline similar to the [Parasite](../jester/parasite.md).

## Gameplay

The Angel is a very broadly useful crew mask, centered around gaining useful knowledge about others and using that knowledge to help them when needed. In this way, it serves as a counterbalance to other more disruptive crew masks, and has a target on their back as a result. Because the Angel is a Guesser-type mask, it incentivizes and rewards basic social deduction gameplay, and a good Angel player could do a lot to help the crew in a dire situation.

Angels provide a little bit of deniability for masks that also are capable of reviving players out of crit on some condition, like the [Subverter](../traitor/subverter.md) or [Parasite](../jester/parasite.md).
