```admonish warning "Notes"
This relies on the 'clues' concept, as does the Insider, and this should be a generic mechanic usable for many things in the future.
The objective adding should probably be delayed by a bit, so the Enthraller has time to get away, but I'm not sure what the best way to actually handle this would be, and this is generically true for some other masks too.

## Concept

The Enthraller captures the minds of others by staring at them, which gives them an objective to prevent the Enthraller's death. Their mask is unaffected--only an objective is added, and all else is unchanged. The objective does not state the Enthraller's name directly--rather, it only gives some clues, like "has brown hair", "middle aged man", or "has a Z in their name". These clues are identical to the clues the [Insider](./insider.md) receives.

> I'm absolutely enthralled by… who was it? they must have been a **young man** with **the letter Z** in their name! I can't let them die.

## Abilities

The Enthraller has a player-targeting action, which causes a series of looping doafters over the course of 15 or 20 seconds. The target can move during this time (the Enthraller cannot), but if they move out of the line of sight of the Enthraller, the doafter ends and the action is put on a short (~30 sec) cooldown.

If the action is successful, the action is put on a ~10(?) minute cooldown, and the target is given the objective mentioned above.

## Gameplay

The Enthraller is a lite-Converter type mask that generally throws a wrench into things while not completely taking over roundflow. Because the objective doesn't state the Enthraller's name, multiple thralls may have to convene and share their clues to figure out who it is.

Enthralling someone, in many cases, can lead to interesting situations. A traitor with an objective to murder the Enthraller may find themselves a thrall, or in general any mask hunting the Enthraller over a grudge or suspicion might find themselves in their grasp instead. Because becoming a thrall doesn't change your mask, characters with wildly diverging goals may find themselves aligned on the task of trying to prevent the Enthraller's death by any means--and medbay could become swarmed by a group of thralls all trying to keep them alive.

The Enthraller's action provides some co-deniability with the [Connoisseur](./connoisseur.md)'s action, which are functionally identical.

## Variants

*Dubious Enthraller* - Objective given is to kill the Enthraller, rather than help them live. But the Enthraller's objective to enthrall people remains. What a conundrum!
*Chaotic Enthraller* - Objective given is to prevent a random person's death, rather than the Enthraller's.
