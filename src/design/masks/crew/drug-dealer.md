## Concept
The drug dealer is a mask that hands out various random pills to people.
The content of these pills is unknown both to the dealer and to the recipient.

## Abilities
The drug dealer can access various caches of pills across the station.
They are given no indication of what each pill does, although all pills of the same chemical will share an appearance.

## Gameplay
The drug dealer takes a simple giver-type role like the [fruit vendor](fruit-vendor.md) but amplifies it through the danger of random pills.
Although some people may be initially willing to take a risk on popping random pills, upon receiving some negative effects, it may become substantially harder to get your pills consumed.
As such, the drug dealer may need to resort to force-feeding or deceiving others to complete their goal, potentially making others thing they are being poisoned or attacked.
While the effects might be beneficial, the drug dealer remains extremely suspicious as they try to slip people bad pills.

## Variants
_Dubious Drug Dealer_ - All the pills have negative effects.

_Professional Drug Dealer_ - The pills have more extreme and intense effects.
