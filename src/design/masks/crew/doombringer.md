## Concept
The doombringer is a mask that significantly advances the radiation storm upon death, creating an exceedingly centralizing crew member that everyone is trying to protect.

## Abilities
When the doombringer dies, the radiation storm timer will be advanced 10 minutes and an announcement will play indicating the storm's new arrival time.

## Gameplay
Since the doombringer's death causes a universally bad outcome for all people on-station, they become an interesting gameplay element that is protected by all sides.
In this way, the doombringer gains a lot of leverage over the crew, as they are more important than everyone else in a very tangible way.
Similarly, any mask that has to target a doombringer has a major obstacle, as they're going to add additional time pressure on themselves as soon as they target the doombringer.

## Variants
**Professional Doombringer:** On death, advance the radstorm 20 minutes instead of 10.
