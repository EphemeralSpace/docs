## Concept

The Veteran is a simple neutral crew mask whose objective sparks conflict and is directly aligned against other troupes--even if those troupes aren't necessarily harmful.

## Abilities

Starts with a small sidearm and a good amount of spare ammo.

## Gameplay

The Veteran provides ambiguity for other masks with weapons or that seek to murder others, like the [Avenger](./avenger.md) or various [Traitor](../traitors.md) masks.

Veterans are unlikely to be particularly lenient with usage of their weapon, as they have a bunch of ammo and no reason not to just fire indiscriminately on people they're suspicious of, beyond that they might get caught doing it. This makes them a frequent instigator of conflict, as well as a deterrent for evildoer troupes and an incentive for would-be murderers to scope out what their target is capable of doing before jumping them.

Ambiguously actually a Veteran. Could very well have just found the gun somewhere. Go nuts.
