## Concept
The vigilante is a mask that must target and kill players who have killed other players in the round.
Unlike the [veteran](veteran.md), which is focused solely on troupe alignment, the vigilante cares about the actions a player has taken during the round, and thus can target any troupe.

## Abilities
Starts with a cache containing some kind of weapon.

## Gameplay
The vigilante provides ambiguity for other masks with weapons that try to kill others, such as [avenger](avenger.md) or [traitor masks](../traitors.md).
However, their condition of the target needing to have killed someone introduces an interesting dillema: directly interfering with an attack does not necessarily fulfill their objective.
Targeting masks like traitors also doesn't even guarantee completion either, as its highly likely that an individual traitor may have not killed anyone.

This also creates a general pressure against enacting violence on others, especially in visible spaces.
Jobs like command or security, who frequently may execute or engage in visible conflict with evil masks, become obvious targets of the vigilante due to not hiding their actions.
This creates a system which self-regulates crew aggression, as blatant murders, even those which are justified, may be retaliated against by a vigilante.
