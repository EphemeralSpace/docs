## Concept
The angry man is a mask that grows increasingly red and angry as other troupes complete their objectives.

## Abilities
The angry man's skin color represents enemy troupe progress.
As the percentage of completed objectives grows, their skin turns more and more red.
When he reaches peak anger, he becomes fully enraged, speaking in all caps and gaining a buff due to his rage.

## Gameplay
The angry man serves as a humorous tattle for the progress of an enemy troupe.
Since they can easily alarm others to when other troupes are advancing their goals, they become an extremely vocal alert as to the state of others.
Additionally, their burst of power at peak anger gives the crew a last-ditch effort to defeat any other troupes before they win.
