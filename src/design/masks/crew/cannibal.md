## Concept

The general function of the Cannibal is to be a "mask-copier". By eating all of someones organs, the Cannibal transforms their own mask into the targets, and has to deal with everything that entails. If a Cannibal succeeds at their new objectives, the original victim will count as succeeding as well.

## Abilities

The Cannibal can naturally butcher mobs for their organs, and if they eat all of one crewmember's organs, will take their mask as their own, including objective completion. The original victim will count as succeeding if the Cannibal succeeds.

## Gameplay

Mask-copiers introduce ambiguity into rounds by not guaranteeing that the gameplay of someone's mask will end even after they die. Furthermore, the condition that the victim succeeds if the Cannibal does introduces a strange win-win incentive that can lead to fun gameplay--perhaps someone's dying wish is to have their organs eaten in order to continue their legacy.

Because the Cannibal copies objective completion, they want to be choosy in which mask they eat, and they have some incentive to delay their feast until it's more guaranteed that they can nab someone whose objectives will be easy. However, the longer they wait, the less it's guaranteed they'll be able to find a good mask to steal and the less time they'll have to complete someone's objectives if their target actually sucked at completing them the entire time.

The act of eating *all of someone's organs* is pretty hard to miss, but can lend some plausible deniability to masks like the [Glutton](./glutton.md) (or vice versa), who may also munch on organs from time to time. The Cannibal must be careful to hide their reprehensible (and messy) deed carefully.

If the Cannibal copies the mask of someone in a differing troupe, they may find it difficult to justify why exactly they're there, providing some strange but fun ambiguity and potential "friends to enemies" situations.
