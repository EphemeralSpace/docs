## Concept
The secretary is a unique "helper"-type role that is assigned to another mask that has personal objectives ([arms dealer](arms-dealer.md), [guzzler](guzzler.md), etc.) and must help them accomplish their objectives.
They are not directly informed of _what_ these objectives are and cannot perform the objectives themselves (in the case of something like the vandal's sabotaging).

## Abilities
The secretary has no special abilities.

## Gameplay
The secretary functions as a kind of natural intensifier for different masks, giving people an allied buddy that works alongside them.
Unlike other bodyguards such as the [avenger](avenger.md), the secretary doesn't necessarily care that their target survives (although that is often helpful) so they may end up tasked with finished their target's work in the event that they perish.

The mask also creates unique social gameplay, as it pairs together potentially unlikely partners, encouraging one to work together and to assist the other in any way they can.
This may result in jobs that otherwise would only briefly intersect needing to stay close together, potentially arousing suspicion.

As a deductive element, the secretary is a general foil for various masks and troupes that team up.
If the secretary doesn't keep a low profile, they might be suspected of being a scheming traitor.
