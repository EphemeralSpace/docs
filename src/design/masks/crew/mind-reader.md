## Concept
The mind reader is a mask who is able to learn hidden information about a character through the use of their mind-reading ability.
Unlike a mask like the [empath](empath.md), the mind reader cannot learn information about masks, but rather only information about a given character.
This includes their name, original shift-start appearance, and hidden details about themselves.

## Abilities
When in a few-tile range of another player, the mind reader can use an action to begin reading the mind of the target player.
This takes the form of several invisible repeating DoAfters which grow in length after each completion.
After a DoAfter completes, the mind reader will be given information about the target in ascending order:
1. True name
2. Original eye color
3. Original hair (style and color)
4. Identifying features (scars, tattoos)
5. Mental traits

If the mind reader is interrupted during this process, either by the target moving out of range or by being attacked, the mind reading will cancel, stunning them and applying a cooldown to the ability.
If uninterrupted, once all the information has been read, the mind reader will exit the ability with no downsides.

## Gameplay
The mind reader's primary purpose is similar to the [bartender](../../jobs/roles/bartender.md), in that they collect clues about people that can be used by other roles.
Additionally, the ability to see through an identity disguise and learn someone's name makes them a powerful counter against what can otherwise be powerful disguise masks.

In terms of their interactions with others, the mind reader is subtly threatening in that they are likely to stalk their target and wait for inactivity in order to start learning information about them.
However, their forced inaction while mind-reading also makes them vulnerable to others.
While it's technically possible to placate a mind reader by willingly allowing them to access your mind, this creates a tradeoff where you have to willingly give up potentially private information.

## Variants
Variants for the mind reader can increase or decrease the strength of their mind-reading as well as potentially expand the information they can learn.
Instead of just learning about character traits, more powerful mind readers could learn about objectives, troupes, or even individual masks.
Weaker variants could introduce faultiness into mind reading, claiming that certain incorrect information is true and that correct information is false.
