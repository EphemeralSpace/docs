## Concept

The Arms Dealer provides an avenue for crew to obtain weapons that are hard to obtain otherwise. However, the Arms Dealer should be wary about who exactly they give out arms to, and to keep their operation secretive but completely legitimate.

## Abilities

The Arms Dealer can materialize a random specific type of small firearm from a hidden cache, once per some medium-length timeframe. If someone stashes an Arms Dealer's gun in their backpack, that gun counts as being "given out". Any kills of crewmembers using an Arms Dealer-spawned gun count towards their fail condition, even to those who guns were not explicitly given to. An Arms Dealers' guns cannot be directly identified as being from an Arms Dealer, or some other source.

## Gameplay

Arms Dealers interact with security by being an obvious source of deadly weaponry entering the crews' hands unnecessarily. However, the Arms Dealer has an incentive to ensure violence doesn't *actually* occur, and security may deign to take the guns themselves to help keep things safe. 

Because an Arms Dealers guns are unidentifiable as being sourced from them, this provides plausible deniability to many masks with guns who may want to obscure why they have one. However, if multiple of the same type of gun are found in many places, it might be reasonable to deduce that an Arms Dealer is about--and maybe even try and locate them, for a nice sidearm. Furthermore, because the fail condition only counts crew deaths, an Arms Dealer might find your request more palatable if you actually have a reasonable justification for using it against non-crew. In events of external invasion, an Arms Dealer is helpful to keep around.
