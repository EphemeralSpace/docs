## Concept

The Guzzler serves the interest of the Universal Beverage Sommelier Coalition (not really) and must drink all kinds of heavenly mana from all kinds of sources. The Guzzler may tail a janitor as they mop the floor, before swooping in to consume all the delicious water and whatever the hell else is in the puddle before it's wasted on evaporation. The Guzzler may bother the bartender endlessly for drinks, inviting some suspicion, before just deciding to break in and steal the entire boozevendor anyway. One thing is for certain: it's guzzlin' time.

## Abilities

The Guzzler can consume more liquids before their stomach is full, and the delay between consumption and metabolism is also lower. Furthermore, their maximum "sip size" for drinks and puddles is considerably larger, meaning their guzzling is more efficient.

## Gameplay

It's not immediately obvious if someone is a Guzzler just from their abilities. It's pretty difficult to notice if someone is "drinking more than they should be capable of", and they can temper that in front of others anyway. Furthermore, some people just like drinking a lot and hanging out in the bar--and masks with ulterior motives will find it easy to pretend to be a Guzzler. The Guzzler's quest for whatever unique reagent they must consume (probably should be from a set list so it's something interesting every time) will probably lead them into strange interactions with the rest of the crew and other masks, and though the stakes from being found out are pretty low, it is a pretty funny situation to be in anyway.
