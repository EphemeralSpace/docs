## Concept

The Amnesiac has no objectives, abilities, items, or background.. at first. After 10-20 minutes, the Amnesiac suddenly remembers their true self, generating a backstory, relationships, and **a new mask**, random from any of the troupes present in the round. They inherit all objectives and abilities of this new mask and must now be careful to not make their new knowledge too obvious while still completing their true objectives.

## Abilities

The Amnesiac inherits all abilities from their new mask once the time comes. If their new mask has items, the Amnesiac will receive a prompt informing them that they now remember the location of a cache of supplies placed sometime before they lost their memory, or by an ally. This uses the same system as [traitor](../traitors.md) caches. This cache only spawns once the Amnesiac remembers, and contains the items they would normally have received at roundstart.

## Gameplay

The core intrigue of the Amnesiac lies in how they act during the period of time before they remember their mask, and how their memory coming back affects their actions. Furthermore, since the mask they gain can be from any troupe in the round, the Amnesiac might have to scramble to integrate themselves into the round in a believable way without garnering too much suspicion from their troupemates. Their new masks objectives may also prove significantly more difficult with the time delay.

The Amnesiac also integrates with mechanics outside of masks. Since they also don't remember their background or relationships, they may need to lie if others pressure them on these subjects, or try to avoid the subject altogether.
