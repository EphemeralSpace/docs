## Concept
The bloodletter is a mask that attacks people with the goal of consuming their blood.

## Abilities
The bloodletter has no special abilities.

## Gameplay
The bloodletter is a freak-type mask that creates low-level conflict across the station through their obsession with blood.
Their desire to make people bleed may cause people to assume they are aggressive, but since they don't want to kill anyone, they are likely to try and reduce escalation.

Their obsession with drinking blood, both the unique types and volume, may cause them to be mistaken for a [guzzler](guzzler.md).
Although they might be able to get some blood from lingering after fights, they may also have to resort to (potentially involuntary) blood drives in order to get the variety they need.
The high overall volume they need to consume may also drive them into medical, where they could potentially chow-down through the medical department's blood reserves.
