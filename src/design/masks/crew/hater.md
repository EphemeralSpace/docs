## Concept
The hater is functionally an "evil" version of the [secretary](secretary.md), who must prevent someone from completing their objectives rather than helping them.
Like their counterpart, they aren't given any info beyond _who_ their target is.

## Abilities
The hater has no special abilities.

## Gameplay
The hater introduces a unique kind of mild antagonism where they must work against their target without needing to explicitly kill them.
For masks like jesters, this might even involve making _sure_ they survive.

As a result, the hater has to carefully observe their target to discover their mask before trying to foil them.
This creates an interesting observation and targeting dynamic, encouraging the target to obscure their intentions and play carefully.
Additionally, the hater's actions may read as antagonistic to others, prompting them to get into conflict with security and veterans.
