```admonish warning "Notes"
I'm not that concrete on the actual mechanics here TBH I thought about making it something like "choose a timeframe and choose life/death" and you get a dynamic amount of GambleBux for riskier bets or something but can't be assed

## Concept

The Gambler is a weird little freak who goes around betting on whether other people will live or die in certain timeframes. If their bets are incorrect, they suffer permanent brain damage as a result.

## Abilities

The Gambler has an action with a 5 minute cooldown which targets a player. They can make a bet on whether that player will live for the next 15 minutes, or will die after 5 minutes, but before 20 minutes. Once a bet is created, it can't be cancelled and a new bet can't be placed on the same player. If the player dies, the Gambler bet for them to die, and the Gambler counted as killing them, the bet fails. If the Gambler fails a bet, they receive some permanent brain damage.

## Gameplay

The Gambler is a passive-active mask that mostly functions as an onlooker of weird situations, only getting involved when their bets are at risk. This makes their motivations appear quite strange to onlookers, and most people would avoid trying to trust an obvious Gambler.

Though they can't kill people to satisfy their death bets (a bit too cheaty), they may look the other way in many situations, or actively stalk targets to help ensure they live--perhaps appearing like a traitor stalking a kill target.

A Gambler's success is mostly luck, but also plenty of strange skill expression: making educated guesses as to who will try to keep themselves alive versus who has a death wish, trailing players to help keep them alive, or barging into medbay to bet that their triage patients will die eventually, then stealing all the meds.

The Gambler's unique death bet condition--that the death must occur after 5 minutes but before 20 minutes--avoids cheesier situations where you might find someone crit and bet on their death seconds before they die. This way, it requires at least a little bit more foresight.
