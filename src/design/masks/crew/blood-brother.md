## Concept

Blood Brother is a linked, team-type mask. Two players will get assigned the Blood Brother role at the same time. Both Blood Brothers will need have eachother's backs and communicate using their radio to ensure they end the round safely together.

## Abilities

Both Blood Brothers spawn with a handheld radio set to a frequency specific to their special radio.

## Gameplay

The blood brother creates an interesting, intimate team dynamic within the ranks of crew, and acts as a bump in the road that any evil-doers have to watch out for. The perfect assasination might not be as simple as getting rid of one person - you might need to find a way to do collateral to take out the blood brothers, or otherwise seperate them apart so that you can take care of them.
