## Concept

The Polymath is a highly variable crew mask that receives two random abilities from other crew masks, as well as two random objectives from other crew masks.

## Abilities

The Polymath's abilities depend on the random abilities chosen for them--for example, from the [Fruit Vendor](./fruit-vendor.md), [Arms Dealer](./arms-dealer.md), [Philanthropist](./philanthropist.md), or [Connoisseur](./connoisseur.md). Abilities are rolled first, and then objectives. Objectives which require for certain abilities--like the Fruit Vendor's objective--should require the corresponding ability. However, other objectives may always roll, even without the corresponding ability.

## Gameplay

The Polymath generates high amounts of variable deniability for essentially any crew mask with an ability--suddenly, being able to spawn fruits out of the aether no longer implies a harmless Fruit Vendor, and it may in fact be a Polymath with the ability to [kill an enemy](./veteran.md) or [set fires](./arsonist.md).

The existence of the Polymath requires people to think more carefully about ability-granting masks, and the randomization allows for some truly strange combinations (Fruit Vendor with [Glutton](./glutton.md) objectives, anyone?).

## Variants

- *Professional Polymath* - Rolls 3 abilities and 3 objectives, rather than 2
