## Concept

The malingerer is a mask that tries to intentionally stoke conflict with others to the point of violence without actually dying as a result.
This makes it a frequent suspect of being some kind of killer or jester, as it operates in similar patterns to those types of masks.

The malingerer is meant to be a improved version of the [daredevil](daredevil.md).

## Abilities

One-time adrenaline if in critical condition like the [parasite](./parasite.md).
Revives them just enough and gives a temporary speed boost to get out and leave if they aren't being directly pursued, but only once.

## Gameplay

Similar to the [daredevil](daredevil.md), the malingerer is a natural source of chaos and strain on the medical department.
However, since the malingerer is unable to simply injure themselves in order to satisfy their goals, they're required to instigate conflicts with others, creating a much more dynamic situation than the more isolated gameplay that would occur with the daredevil.

This overall creates a mask that, while enjoying causing and being the center of conflict on the station, ultimately wants to keep it to a level where everyone walks away alive.

## Variants

**Professional Malingerer:** The adrenaline ability receives multiple charges and is more potent.

**Chaotic Malingerer:** The damage sources that it must take in order to succeed are more varied and obscure.
