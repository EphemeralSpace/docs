## Concept

The Vandal is a mask centered around breaking into and [sabotaging](../../machine-degradation.md) machines around the station.

## Abilities

The Vandal has the ability to sabotage targeted machines, the same way [traitors](../traitors.md) do.

## Gameplay

Claiming to be a Vandal, and the supposed existence of a Vandal, can go a long way in giving traitors avenues to get out of being arrested for sabotaging stuff and getting caught. Furthermore, once more than just the traitor troupe exists, it means that a surplus of sabotaged machines or a directly-witnessed sabotager are not smoking guns for the existence of traitors onboard the station.

More directly, the Vandal's objective, and relative lack of tools to accomplish it, leads them into generic potential conflict with many people around the station.
