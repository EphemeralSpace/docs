This mask is technically dependent on tile fires existing to function properly.

## Concept

The Arsonist lights fires around the station, and tries to leave the scene of the crime before anyone notices what occurs.

## Abilities

Receives a matchbox and some fuel in a soda can as part of their items.

## Gameplay

Lends ambiguity to situations where fires occur. Normally, they might be the result of miscellaneous sabotage, power incidents, random machinery mishaps, or just random events/wildcards--but what if there's actually an arsonist aboard? Also directly provides reactive gameplay for engineers/atmospheric technicians.

Their items are nothing special, and could be randomized heavily or omitted entirely to make identifying an arsonist directly more difficult.
