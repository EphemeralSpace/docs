## Concept

The Avenger is a guardian-type mask, but specifically for their target being murdered. If the target dies from environmental hazards, the Avenger still succeeds. However, in the event that a murder of their target occurs, they must seek out the perpetrator and enact revenge.

## Abilities

The Avenger is always notified if their target dies, and where, even if the death wasn't a murder. However, if the death was a murder, the Avenger receives an action that allows them to periodically detect how close the perpetrator is to them. If the perpetrator is killed by the Avenger, the Avenger is notified that they feel at peace. However, if the perpetrator dies by any other means, the Avenger can no longer succeed at their objectives. It must be a perfect vengeance.

## Gameplay

As a guardian-type mask, the Avenger provides some incentive for crew to not randomly murder people, in case it might invoke the Avenger's wrath, among other reasons.

Since certain masks may actually desire to be murdered, if the Avenger targets them some funny conflict may arise. Consider a [Parasite](../jester/parasite.md) who is being protected by an Avenger. If the Parasite is murdered and swaps places with their murderer, they may now found themselves being targeted by their own protector.

The Avenger provides some plausible deniability for masks that seek to murder others, since the Avenger is typically actually doing it for a good reason. Other masks may find it prudent to lie about being an Avenger with good intentions.
