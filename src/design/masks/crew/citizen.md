> **Name:** Citizen

> **Troupe:** [Crew](../crew.md)

## Concept
The Citizen is a true neutral mask akin to something like the "innocent" in mafia.
They make up a consistently high proportion of the crew troupe, decreasing the total number of masks that you might see in a round.

Note however that Citizens are not inherently "good" people.
Although they won't blow up the station in a nuclear blast, they are more than happy to do what they will to fulfill their own selfish desires.

## Abilities
None

## Gameplay
The Citizen is a very basic role that brings the baseline level of chaos down to a more reasonable level.
They serve to introduce a very neutral "default" for players to inhabit that allows them to more directly focus on their job and the troupe objective.

In terms of intrigue, the Citizen is the most obvious role to try to pretend to be.
Since they lack any tells or goals, someone can always be a Citizen with no way of proving they are not short of confirming something else.
