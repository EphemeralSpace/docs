## Concept
The citizen is a mask that starts with a citizenship card with their name on it. This card does nothing other then acting as a meta-confirmation that they're the citizen, as only the citizen can spawn with the card. They have no other special abilities or objectives.

## Abilities
See above section.

## Gameplay
The citizen acts as a sort of "soft-safe-check" and sets the stage for social intruige relating to its card. For example, the citizen might use their card to confirm their innocence at a crucial time.... or maybe, someone's stolen the citizen's card and is trying to use it to do the same, which acts as a seed for further social intruige.
