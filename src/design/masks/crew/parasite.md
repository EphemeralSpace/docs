## Concept

Parasite is a jester-type mind-swapper. If they're killed by someone else, the Parasite uses the opportunity to swap minds with the murderer. This process shunts the murderer's mind into the Parasite's old body, while also swapping masks--i.e., the murderer is now a Parasite and the old Parasite takes on the mask and body of their murderer. Once the swap happens, the Parasite-body's death is cancelled and given an adrenaline boost to allow them to escape the situation, while the murderer-body is stunned for a small amount of time.

## Abilities

Parasitism and adrenaline-revival as mentioned above.

## Gameplay

As a mind-swapper, the Parasite can lead to a whole host of very confusing, silly, and fun situations. An [Assassin](../traitor/assassin.md) may kill you, but you now take over their body and must slide into their mask effortlessly. Maybe you reveal the predicament to the other traitors--who find it unnerving but simply accept it as a fact of reality, and abandon their old friend.

Parasites also have strange interactions with protective roles, as a jester-type. An [Avenger](./parasite.md) may be protecting you, but will suddenly start hunting you after you swap into the body of your murderer.

Because the murderer receives the Parasite mask after swapping, they must now pawn the Parasite off onto someone else and steal another body, leading to a chain of hilarity and obfuscation.

The Parasite's existence disincentivizes murdering random people if you don't have to, while not being a completely black-and-white fail condition like normal jester-type roles.
