> **Name:** Mercenary

>
> **Description:** Get sent a traitor goods cache. Use it to help the crew. Try not to get the blame pinned on yourself.

## Concept
At the beginning of the round, the mercenary gets a random [traitor](../traitor.md) gear cache, corresponding to an existing traitor mask.

## Abilities
The mercenary has no other special abilities or objectives other then their round-start traitor cache.

## Gameplay
The existence of the Mercenary reduces the probability of metagaming traitors by finding their items, and allows for humorous, chaotic situations to arrive from the usage of said items on the crew's side. The mercenary's existence also forces security to try and deduce if someone is a traitor through their actions instead of their items.
