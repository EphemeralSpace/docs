## Concept
The Mercenary gets their own traitor gear cache at the beginning of the round. They have no other special abilities or objectives.

## Abilities
See above section.

## Gameplay
The existence of the Mercenary reduces the probability of metagaming traitors by finding their items, and allows for humorous, chaotic situations to arrive from the usage of said items on the crew's side. The mercenary's existence also forces security to try and deduce if someone is a traitor through their actions instead of their items.
