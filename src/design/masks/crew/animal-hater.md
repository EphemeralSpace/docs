## Concept

The Animal Hater must seek out and Eliminate small creatures on the station, including pets.

## Abilities

No special abilities.

## Gameplay

The Animal Hater can provide plausible deniability to many masks that wish to kill creatures, or to wildcards that end up killing creatures as part of their normal gameplay. Is that dead mouse someone being annoyed, or a secret Animal Hater aboard the station? The targeted objective means that the Animal Hater generally comes into direct conflict with someone who owns the animal in question or has a vested interest in it not being killed.
