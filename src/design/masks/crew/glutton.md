## Concept

The Glutton is a lover of all types of cuisine, and seeks out many types of new foods to try, functioning as a sort of food variant of the [Guzzler](./guzzler.md). They will likely pester the chef, their archnemesis who the Glutton nevertheless cannot survive without, for more foodstuffs. However, it's likely any real Glutton will view this as insufficient and will opt for their own cooking--including some perhaps unsavory meals in the shadows made from the bodies of vermin in maintenance. It's possible the Glutton's exotic taste will even veer into the illegal, if some organs are left unattended.

## Abilities

The Glutton can consume more food before their stomach is full, and the delay between consumption and metabolism is also lower. Furthermore, their maximum "bite size" for food is considerably larger, and they can never be considered "overfed".

## Gameplay

It's difficult to tell for certain if someone is a Glutton, since everyone needs to eat. Their need for new foods will probably lead them into strange interactions, especially since it doesnt have be a cooked meal. Eating organs is an obvious avenue--which may make them appear like a [Cannibal](./cannibal.md). Trawling through maintenance for weird foods and for exotic fauna to eat may lead them into conflict with any number of masks. The chef might be happy that someone appreciates their cooking, but they're unlikely to be happy for long with someone who essentially operates like a human mouse eating everything in sight.
