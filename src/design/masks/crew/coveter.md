```admonish warning "Notes"
I don't know what the best way to handle swapping and troupe stuff is. Obviously if a traitor gets swapped with a crew mask, they'll have an incentive to immediately out their old traitor buddies in some way, since they have knowledge in that situation. Maybe it's better if mask swapping doesn't change the troupe (obviously kind of a difficult ask but I can't really see a better), i.e. there'd just be a traitor coveter, and a crew marauder or whatever, as weird as that is.

## Concept

The Coveter is a Swapper-Guesser type mask, injecting some intrigue into the round by messing up deduction and swapping things around--potentially multiple times.

## Abilities

Once per player, the Coveter can try to guess their mask. On failure, they receive a small amount of brain damage. On success, they swap masks--the guessed player becomes a Coveter with the same objective, and the old Coveter takes their mask and objective completion.

Once the first swap happens, the new Coveter is put on a time limit--30 minutes at first, halving with each subsequent passing along of the mask. If they fail to guess someone's mask in time, they'll explode into viscera.

On conversion into a Coveter, you are barred from targeting your converter with the Coveter's ability to avoid "tag-back" situations.

## Gameplay

The Coveter is a mask which can quickly devolve into completely insane situations and absolute hilarity, even with just one guess. Stealing someone's mask is sure to get them angry at you, though they'll soon enough find themselves preoccupied with trying to covet someone else's mask before they explode. If this chains enough, it can lead to a "hot potato" situation where everyone is trying to find someone to quickly pass the mask off to.

Swapping in general is a huge wrench to throw into deduction--someone you thought you knew as a friend could become your enemy, you might have to suddenly deal with a completely different traitor partner, or your careful surveilling of a target could go haywire as they become someone completely different.
