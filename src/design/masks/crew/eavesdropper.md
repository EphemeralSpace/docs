## Concept
The eavesdropper is a mask who can select a target to begin "eavesdropping on them."
From then on, they are able to hear everything their target can hear and must protect their target.

## Abilities
At the beginning of the round, the eavesdropper has an action they can use on another player to select them as their target.
Once a player is selected, the eavesdropper will gain an objective to protect their target, with the target being notified about the situation with a popup.

After that, the eavesdropper can now hear everything their target can hear, including both regular speech and radio.
This ability cannot be toggled off and persists until their target perishes.

## Gameplay
The eavesdropper creates a highly invasive, asymmetrical, and dependant relationship with the person they select as their target.
Since the eavesdropper is always listening in on them, the target is forced to consider the info insecurity of the people around them.
However, since the target knows that they want to be kept alive, they gain an ally who can be communicated with (in a one-sided fashion) at any time.

This creates a much more tightly-knit guardian mask than something like the [avenger](avenger.md), as the two are always in contact and able to exchange information.
Additionally, this makes the target of the eavesdropper even more daunting to approach, as anything you tell or do to them could very quickly be spread to the station as a whole.
