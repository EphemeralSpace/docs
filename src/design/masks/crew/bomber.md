The bomber is--he's like, he's from the Greed Island arc and he puts bombs on people and stuff. Anyway I lied and my bombs are super real and you should probably be really freaking scared right now.*

## Concept

The Bomber is a deadly mask with similar mechanics to the [Tracker](./tracker.md). By targeting someone with an action and then speaking one of their random codewords in a sentence while in the target's proximity, a bomb will silently be attached to the target. This bomb will detonate once the target reaches critical condition, and the Bomber's goal is to kill or maim someone else using the explosion.

## Abilities

See above. The bomber receives a set list of codewords (similar to upstream traitor codewords) that can be used to place a bomb. Two bombs can be placed at a time, and if both are placed one must be disarmed or go off in order to place a new bomb. Bombs can only be disarmed by the Bomber, by speaking the codeword again in proximity of the target.

## Gameplay

Forensics can be used to detect if a bomb was placed on someone and several candidates for who could have done it, but this of course requires suspicion that one was placed to begin with, or the body of someone that already succumbed to the bomber. Targets killed by the bomb's explosion (since it triggers on crit) count as being killed by the Bomber for the purposes of on-death masks. If the Bomber dies, their bombs are disarmed and the targets are notified that something occurred. The Bomber receives no penalty if the bomb fails to kill anyone else--they simply must get one eventually for their objective to pass. 

Detecting the Bomber's presence requires an already-existing suspicion that one is present (to check forensics). It's not immediately clear, when someone goes into crit, whether the explosion was the result of the Bomber or something unrelated, but the intent is that it should be possible to infer that it was a Bomber, and for people to take actions accordingly. 

The intrigue comes from determining who the Bomber could be by narrowing down options from forensics or using basic logic, whether what someone is saying could potentially be a hidden code phrase, and trying to figure out if you were inflicted with a bomb so you can avoid going into crit.

Additionally, the Bomber provides ambiguity for the [Tracker](./tracker.md)'s gameplay, as their codeword-marking functions identically. Those who suspect others are using codewords can never be positive whether it's to harm them or help them.
