## Concept
The fruit vendor is a mask that gives out fruit to people.

## Abilities
Like the [Arms Dealer](../crew/arms-dealer.md), the fruit vendor can materialize a fruit from a hidden cache, once per some medium-length timeframe.

## Gameplay
The fruit vendor acts as another kind of "soft-safe-check," much like the [citizen+](../crew/citizen-plus.md). As a result, the interactions this mask creates are mostly similar, with the caveat that this mask can have subverted versions (neutral and chaotic fruit vendor) that change the viability of the fruits. This makes the completion of their objective more difficult than it otherwise would be, and introduces a new layer of humorous social deduction. Sure, maybe you can be confident that the fruit vendor isn't a traitor, but can you ever really trust their fruits?
