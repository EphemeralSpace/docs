## Concept
The fruit vendor is a mask that starts with a bluespace fruit bag. They can take fruits out of it (limited by a cooldown.)

## Abilities
See above section.

## Gameplay
The fruit vendor acts as another kind of "soft-safe-check," much like the [citizen](../crew/citizen.md). As a result, the interactions this mask creates are mostly similar, with the caveat that this mask can have subverted versions (neutral and chaotic fruit vendor) that change the viability of the fruits. This makes the completion of their objective more difficult then it otherwise would be, and introduces a new layer of humorous social deduction. Sure, maybe you can be confident that the fruit vendor isn't a traitor, but can you ever really trust their fruits?
