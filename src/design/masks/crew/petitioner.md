## Concept
The Petitioner is a mask that can create a "petition" on any given piece of paper and must get crew members to sign it.
Signing the petition is done either by writing your name on the petition or by stamping it with any stamp.

Note that the petition has to physically exist at the end of the round to count for the objective.
If the petition is destroyed before or after the signatures are collected, a new petition must be created.

## Abilities
None

## Gameplay
The Petitioner is a unique role in that they are at the mercy of other players and as such can be easily extorted.
Trading favors for signatures is a mutually beneficial action, and takes advantage of the moral dubiousness of crew roles.
While you can likely deny the first few requests, you will eventually need to capitulate and work to finalize the petition.

Alternatively, the fact that the petition signing is done entirely in-world with normal mechanics means that the petitioner is a great mask to base deception around.
Signing a petition is a common roleplay gimmick and as such can be executed decently well without explicitly divulging you are the petitioner.
Other masks can also pose as the petitioner, using the lack of a hard check as a way to get close to others and reduce suspicion.
