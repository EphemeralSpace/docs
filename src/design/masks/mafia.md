# Mafia

{{#template ../../templates/unimplemented.md }}

The mafia is a **minor troupe** focused on station control, voluntary conversion, and evolution.
It focuses on the [godfather](mafia/godfather.md), a mask who spawns directly on the station, and the various members of their family, who either came from or will be recruited from the crew.
As a collective, the mafia must take control of station and complete telescience, ensuring that the station (and Don) escape harm.

As a force, the mafia is not immediately harmful to the average person on the station.
The main goal of hijacking the station to bring it under the wider Italian-American control, while causing [crew](crew.md) to lose, is not fatal like other troupes.
Additionally, players can opt to join the mafia (if the godfather permits them), meaning that they can enjoy a relatively bloodless shift if they play their cards right.

However, if the mafia is defeated, whether by [other troupes](traitors.md) getting a win or just through security and command taking down the organization, all the members of the mafia will lose.
This creates a shifting dynamic, where the mafia can only grow if the crew have confidence in their ability to win, yet the instability of the crew is one that opens up other troupes to win.

```admonish tip "Important Note"
All members of the mafia have the inherent ability to craft a trenchcoat and fedora using cloth.

## Base of Operations
The mafia hideout is a dedicated area of the map, consisting of a maintenance bar with a heavily reinforced blast doors.
It's accessible on the map regardless of the troupes in play, although it will spawn with additional equipment if the mafia is active.

In a mafia round, the godfather will spawn here instead of the shuttle.
This provides them with some time to gather supplies, fortify themselves, and come up with a plan.
Additionally, once the other mafia members arrive on-station, it also serves as a place for them to organize and store supplies.

The mafia base serves as an ever-present target for security, yet due to the mafia's overwhelming firepower, it shouldn't be taken due to the high risk of casualties.

## Objectives
To win, the mafia must keep the godfather alive and seize control of the station.
When these goals are done, the completion of telescience will end the round as a mafia victory, causing crew to lose.

Control of the station is dictated by the **interspace navigation terminal**, located inside the bridge.
When at this terminal, the godfather can begin a ~2-minute-long process to reroute it to Italian-American sector space.

The rerouting causes a loud announcement to play, alerting any remaining crew to the situation.
Once the station has rerouted, any non-mafia member can reverse the routing, returning the station back to Nanotrasen control.

## Growing the Family
The godfather has the option to, at any point, proposition any player to become a member of the mafia.
The offered player can then choose to either accept or decline the offer (except if they are security, command, or a non-crew troupe, in which case they can only decline).
If the player accepts the offer, they will lose their current mask and become a [goon](mafia/goon.md).

This creates a progression in the round, as goons kill crew members in order to level up, weakening the crew and drawing heat on the mafia.
This however also limits the pool for future mafia members, potentially starving the mafia if too many members die off.

## Succession

> *The true mafioso understands the value in loyalty...*

If the godfather dies or loses their mask at any point, another member of the mafia will be promoted into a new godfather.
The player selected is based on rank, starting with the [underboss](mafia/underboss.md), then the [consigliere](mafia/consigliere.md), before finally just picking a random goon.

This provides a failsafe to the mafia as a whole.
Simply killing the godfather, while likely to set them back, is not going to
